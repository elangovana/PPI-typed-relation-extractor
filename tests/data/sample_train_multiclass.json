Previously, we have shown that human somatic Wee1 (Wee1A) is down-regulated both by protein phosphorylation and degradation, but the underlying mechanisms had not been elucidated. In the present study, we have identified the beta-transducin repeat-containing protein 1\/2 (beta-TrCP1\/2) F-box protein-containing SKP1\/Cul1\/F-box protein (SCF) complex (SCF(beta-TrCP1\/2)) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Wee1A ubiquitination. Although Wee1A lacks a consensus DS(p)GXXS(p) phospho-dependent binding motif for beta-TrCP, recognition of Wee1A by beta-TrCP depended on phosphorylation, and two serine residues in Wee1A, S53 and S123, were found to be the most important phosphorylation sites for beta-TrCP recognition. We have found also that the major M-phase kinases polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and Cdc2 are responsible for the phosphorylation of S53 and S123, respectively, and that in each case phosphorylation generates an unconventional phospho-degron (signal for degradation) that can be recognized by beta-TrCP. Phosphorylation of Wee1A by these kinases cooperatively stimulated the recognition and ubiquitination of Wee1A by SCF(beta-TrCP1\/2) in vitro. Mutation of these residues or depletion of beta-TrCP by small-interfering RNA treatment increased the stability of Wee1A in HeLa cells. Moreover, our analysis indicates that beta-TrCP-dependent degradation of Wee1A is important for the normal onset of M-phase in vivo. These results also establish the existence of a feedback loop between Cdc2 and Wee1A in somatic cells that depends on ubiquitination and protein degradation and ensures the rapid activation of Cdc2 when cells are ready to divide.","656":"COP1 (constitutively photomorphogenic 1) is a RING-finger-containing protein that functions to repress plant photomorphogenesis, the light-mediated programme of plant development. Mutants of COP1 are constitutively photomorphogenic, and this has been attributed to their inability to negatively regulate the proteins LAF1 (ref. 1) and HY5 (ref. 2). The role of COP1 in mammalian cells is less well characterized. Here we identify the tumour-suppressor protein p53 as a COP1-interacting protein. COP1 increases p53 turnover by targeting it for degradation by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-dependent fashion, independently of MDM2 or Pirh2, which are known to interact with and negatively regulate p53. Moreover, COP1 serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53 in vitro and in vivo, and inhibits p53-dependent transcription and apoptosis. Depletion of COP1 by short interfering RNA (siRNA) stabilizes p53 and arrests cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, we identify COP1 as a p53-inducible gene, and show that the depletion of COP1 and MDM2 by siRNA cooperatively sensitizes U2-OS cells to ionizing-radiation-induced cell death. Overall, these results indicate that COP1 is a critical negative regulator of p53 and represents a new pathway for maintaining p53 at low levels in unstressed cells.","632":"AKT pathway has a critical role in mediating signaling transductions for cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Previous studies have shown that AKT activation is achieved through a series of phosphorylation steps: first, AKT is phosphorylated at Thr-450 by JNK kinases to prime its activation; then, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 phosphorylates AKT at Thr-308 to expose the Ser-473 residue; and finally, AKT is phosphorylated at Ser-473 by several kinases (PKD2 and others) to achieve its full activation. For its inactivation, the PH-domain containing phosphatases dephosphorylate AKT at Ser-473, and protein serine\/threonine phosphatase-2A (PP-2A) dephosphorylates it at Thr-308. However, it remains unknown regarding which phosphatase dephosphorylates AKT at Thr-450 during its inactivation. In this study, we present both in vitro and in vivo evidence to show that protein serine\/threonine phosphatase-1 (PP-1) is a major phosphatase that directly dephosphorylates AKT to modulate its activation. First, purified PP-1 directly dephosphorylates AKT in vitro. Second, immunoprecipitation and immunocolocalization showed that PP-1 interacts with AKT. Third, stable knock down of PP-1alpha or PP-1beta but not PP-1gamma, PP-2Aalpha or PP-2Abeta by shRNA leads to enhanced phosphorylation of AKT at Thr-450. Finally, overexpression of PP-1alpha or PP-1beta but not PP-1gamma, PP-2Aalpha or PP-2Abeta results in attenuated phosphorylation of AKT at Thr-450. Moreover, our results also show that dephosphorylation of AKT by PP-1 significantly modulates its functions in regulating the expression of downstream genes, promoting cell survival and modulating differentiation. These results show that PP-1 acts as a major phosphatase to dephosphorylate AKT at Thr-450 and thus modulate its functions.","433":"Following genotoxic stress, cells activate a complex signalling network to arrest the cell cycle and initiate DNA repair or apoptosis. The tumour suppressor p53 lies at the heart of this DNA damage response. However, it remains incompletely understood, which signalling molecules dictate the choice between these different cellular outcomes. Here, we identify the transcriptional regulator apoptosis-antagonizing transcription factor (AATF)\/Che-1 as a critical regulator of the cellular outcome of the p53 response. Upon genotoxic stress, AATF is phosphorylated by the checkpoint kinase MK2. Phosphorylation results in the release of AATF from cytoplasmic MRLC3 and subsequent nuclear translocation where AATF binds to the PUMA, BAX and BAK promoter regions to repress p53-driven expression of these pro-apoptotic genes. In xenograft experiments, mice exhibit a dramatically enhanced response of AATF-depleted tumours following genotoxic chemotherapy with adriamycin. The exogenous expression of a phospho-mimicking AATF point mutant results in marked adriamycin resistance in vivo. Nuclear AATF enrichment appears to be selected for in p53-proficient endometrial cancers. Furthermore, focal copy number gains at the AATF locus in neuroblastoma, which is known to be almost exclusively p53-proficient, correlate with an adverse prognosis and reduced overall survival. These data identify the p38\/MK2\/AATF signalling module as a critical repressor of p53-driven apoptosis and commend this pathway as a target for DNA damage-sensitizing therapeutic regimens.","303":"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) triggers a signaling pathway converging on the activation of NF-kappaB, which forms the basis for many physiological and pathological processes. In a kinase gene screen using a NF-kappaB reporter, we observed that overexpression of casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha) enhanced TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, and a CK1alpha kinase dead mutant, CK1alpha (K46A), reduced NF-kappaB activation induced by TNFalpha. We subsequently demonstrated that CK1alpha interacted with receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1) but not with TRADD, TRAF2, MEKK3, IKKalpha, IKKbeta, or IKKgamma in mammalian cells. RIP1 is an indispensable molecule in TNFalpha\/NF-kappaB signaling. We demonstrated that CK1alpha interacted with and phosphorylated RIP1 at the intermediate domain. Finally, we showed that CK1alpha enhanced RIP1-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Taken together, our studies suggest that CK1alpha is another kinase that regulates RIP1 function in NF-kappaB activation.","1261":"In an effort to clone novel tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates of the epidermal growth factor receptor, we have initiated an approach coupling affinity purification using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to mass spectrometry-based identification. Here, we report the identification of a signaling molecule containing a Src homology 3 domain as well as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). This molecule is 55% identical to a previously isolated molecule designated signal transducing adaptor molecule (STAM) that was identified as an interleukin (IL)-2-induced phosphoprotein and is therefore designated STAM2. Tyrosine phosphorylation of STAM2 is induced by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor as well as by cytokines like IL-3. Several of the deletion mutants tested except the one containing only the amino-terminal region underwent tyrosine phosphorylation upon growth factor stimulation, implying that STAM2 is phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues. STAM2 is downstream of the Jak family of kinases since coexpression of STAM2 with Jak1 or Jak2 but not an unrelated Tec family kinase, Etk, resulted in its tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast to epidermal growth factor receptor-induced phosphorylation, this required the ITAM domain since mutants lacking this region did not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, overexpression of wild type STAM2 led to an increase in IL-2-mediated induction of c-Myc promoter activation indicating that it potentiates cytokine receptor signaling.","509":"The protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) acts on several kinases in the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway but whether a specific holoenzyme dephosphorylates ERK and whether this activity is controlled during mitogenic stimulation is unknown. By using both RNA interference and overexpression of PP2A B regulatory subunits, we show that B56, but not B, family members of PP2A increase ERK dephosphorylation, without affecting its activation by MEK. Induction of the early gene product and ERK substrate IEX-1 (ier3) by growth factors leads to opposite effects and reverses B56-PP2A-mediated ERK dephosphorylation. IEX-1 binds to B56 subunits and pERK independently, enhances B56 phosphorylation by ERK at a conserved Ser\/Pro site in this complex and triggers dissociation from the catalytic subunit. This is the first demonstration of the involvement of B56-containing PP2A in ERK dephosphorylation and of a B56-specific cellular protein inhibitor regulating its activity in an ERK-dependent fashion. In addition, our results raise a new paradigm in ERK signaling in which ERK associated to a substrate can transphosphorylate nearby proteins.","763":"We used a substrate-trapping technique to search for substrates of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B. A catalytically inactive form of this enzyme forms a stable, phosphotyrosine-dependent complex with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) both in vitro and in cells. PTP1B also interacts with activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) but not with colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R). After binding to EGFR, PTP1B becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated at Tyr-66, a site that conforms to the consensus binding sequence for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the adapter protein Grb2. This tyrosine phosphorylation is correlated with a 3-fold increase in PTP catalytic activity. These findings suggest that PTP1B selectively regulates specific activated receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) in vivo and might itself be regulated by such receptors.","952":"Akt\/protein kinase B is a major cell survival pathway through phosphorylation of proapoptotic proteins Bad and Bax and of additional apoptotic pathways linked to Forkhead proteins glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and ASK1. To further explore the mechanism by which Akt regulates cell survival, we identified an Akt interaction protein by yeast two-hybrid screening. It is highly homologous to ARG-binding protein 2 (ArgBP2) with splicing exon 8 of the coding region of the ArgBP2. As two splicing isoforms (ArgBP2alpha and -beta) of ArgBP2 have been identified (Wang, B., Golemis, E. A., and Kruh, G. D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 17542-17550), it was named ArgBP2gamma. ArgBP2gamma contains four Akt phosphorylation consensus sites, a SoHo motif, and three Src homology (SH) 3 domains and binds to C-terminal proline-rich motifs of Akt through its first and second SH3 domains. It also interacts with p21-activated protein kinase (PAK1) via its first and third SH3 domains, indicating the SH3 domains of ArgBP2gamma as docking sites for Akt and PAK1. Akt phosphorylates ArgBP2gamma in vitro and in vivo. Expression of ArgBP2gamma induces PAK1 activity and overrides apoptosis induced by ectopic expression of Bad or DNA damage. Nonphosphorylatable ArgBP2gamma-4A and SH3 domain-truncated mutant ArgBP2gamma inhibit Akt-induced PAK1 activation and reduce Akt and PAK1 phosphorylation of Bad and antiapoptotic function. These data indicate that ArgBP2gamma is a physiological substrate of Akt, functions as an adaptor for Akt and PAK1, and plays a role in Akt\/PAK1 cell survival pathway.","484":"To gain insight into the function of human protein kinase X (PrKX), a signal-transduction protein required for macrophage differentiation, we identified regulatory subunit I alpha of protein kinase A, T54 and Smad6 as partners for this protein using a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen. Interactions between PrKX and these proteins were substantiated by co-immunoprecipitation. Interaction between Smad6 and PrKX was also confirmed in human myeloid HL-60 cells following their phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation into macrophages. In vitro phosphorylation assays demonstrated that PrKX phosphorylates Smad6 at a serine residue. Mutagenesis of this site resulted in abrogation of PrKX phosphorylation. Both PrKX and Smad6 were shown to be co-localized to the nuclear compartment of HL-60 cells during their macrophage differentiation where PrKX levels are induced and Smad6 protein levels remain relatively constant while levels of serine phosphorylation of Smad6 increase. By using in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation, we also demonstrate that during macrophage differentiation Smad6 displays an increased binding to the human osteopontin, Id2, and Hex gene promoters, which correlates to an observed increased expression of these genes. Finally, vector-based RNA interference experiments established that both Smad6 and PrKX proteins are required for PMA-induced cell attachment and spreading.","709":"hDlg, the human homologue of the Drosophila Discs-large (Dlg) tumor suppressor protein, is known to interact with the tumor suppressor protein APC and the human papillomavirus E6 transforming protein. In a two-hybrid screen, we identified a 322-aa serine\/threonine kinase that binds to the PDZ2 domain of hDlg. The mRNA for this PDZ-binding kinase, or PBK, is most abundant in placenta and absent from adult brain tissue. The protein sequence of PBK has all the characteristic protein kinase subdomains and a C-terminal PDZ-binding T\/SXV motif. In vitro, PBK binds specifically to PDZ2 of hDlg through its C-terminal T\/SXV motif. PBK and hDlg are phosphorylated at mitosis in HeLa cells, and the mitotic phosphorylation of PBK is required for its kinase activity. In vitro, cdc2\/cyclin B phosphorylates PBK. This evidence shows how PBK could link hDlg or other PDZ-containing proteins to signal transduction pathways regulating the cell cycle or cellular proliferation.","1113":"The breast cancer tumor-suppressor gene, BRCA1, encodes a protein with a BRCT domain-a motif that is found in many proteins that are implicated in DNA damage response and in genome stability. Phosphorylation of BRCA1 by the DNA damage-response proteins ATM, ATR and hCds1\/Chk2 changes in response to DNA damage and at replication-block checkpoints. Although cells that lack BRCA1 have an abnormal response to DNA damage, the exact role of BRCA1 in this process has remained unclear. Here we show that BRCA1 is essential for activating the Chk1 kinase that regulates DNA damage-induced G2\/M arrest. Thus, BRCA1 controls the expression, phosphorylation and cellular localization of Cdc25C and Cdc2\/cyclin B kinase-proteins that are crucial for the G2\/M transition. We show that BRCA1 regulates the expression of both Wee1 kinase, an inhibitor of Cdc2\/cyclin B kinase, and the 14-3-3 family of proteins that sequesters phosphorylated Cdc25C and Cdc2\/cyclin B kinase in the cytoplasm. We conclude that BRCA1 regulates key effectors that control the G2\/M checkpoint and is therefore involved in regulating the onset of mitosis.","1290":"A zinc finger protein, ZPR9, has been identified as a physiological substrate of murine protein serine\/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38), which is involved in various cellular responses, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, embryonic development, and oncogenesis. Here, ZPR9 was found to physically interact with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) through a disulfide linkage involving Cys(1351) and Cys(1360) of ASK1 and Cys(305) and Cys(308) of ZPR9. ASK1 directly phosphorylated ZPR9 at Ser(314) and Thr(318), suggesting that ZPR9 can act as an ASK1 substrate. Ectopic expression of wild-type ZPR9, but not an S314A\/T318A mutant, stimulated ASK1 kinase activity and positively regulated ASK1-mediated signaling to both JNK and p38 kinases by destabilizing complex formation between ASK1 and its negative regulators, Trx and 14-3-3, or by increasing complex formation between ASK1 and its substrate MKK3. ZPR9 functionally stimulated ASK1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity as well as H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. ASK1-mediated phosphorylation of ZPR9 at Ser(314) and Thr(318) was also responsible for ZPR9-induced apoptosis. Moreover, ZPR9 inhibited PDK1-mediated signaling through ASK1 activation. These results suggest that ZPR9 functions as a novel positive regulator of ASK1.","855":"Defining the links between cell division and DNA replication is essential for understanding normal cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis. In this report we explore the effect of phosphorylation of cell division cycle 6 (Cdc6), a DNA replication initiation factor, by polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) on the regulation of chromosomal segregation. In mitosis, the phosphorylation of Cdc6 was highly increased, in correlation with the level of Plk1, and conversely, Cdc6 is hypophosphorylated in Plk1-depleted cells, although cyclin A- and cyclin B1-dependent kinases are active. Binding between Cdc6 and Plk1 occurs through the polo-box domain of Plk1, and Cdc6 is phosphorylated by Plk1 on T37. Immunohistochemistry studies reveal that Cdc6 and Plk1 colocalize to the central spindle in anaphase. Expression of T37V mutant of Cdc6 (Cdc6-TV) induces binucleated cells and incompletely separated nuclei. Wild-type Cdc6 but not Cdc6-TV binds cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). Expression of wild-type Plk1 but not kinase-defective mutant promotes the binding of Cdc6 to Cdk1. Cells expressing wild-type Cdc6 display lower Cdk1 activity and higher separase activity than cells expressing Cdc6-TV. These results suggest that Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc6 promotes the interaction of Cdc6 and Cdk1, leading to the attenuation of Cdk1 activity, release of separase, and subsequent anaphase progression.","1297":"A zinc finger protein, ZPR9, has been identified as a physiological substrate of murine protein serine\/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38), which is involved in various cellular responses, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, embryonic development, and oncogenesis.

ZPR9 functionally stimulated ASK1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity as well as H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. ASK1-mediated phosphorylation of ZPR9 at Ser(314) and Thr(318) was also responsible for ZPR9-induced apoptosis. Moreover, ZPR9 inhibited PDK1-mediated signaling through ASK1 activation. These results suggest that ZPR9 functions as a novel positive regulator of ASK1.","1100":"The p53 cofactor Strap (stress responsive activator of p300) is directly targeted by the DNA damage signalling pathway where phosphorylation by ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) kinase facilitates nuclear accumulation. Here, we show that Strap regulation reflects the coordinated interplay between different DNA damage-activated protein kinases, ATM and Chk2 (Checkpoint kinase 2), where phosphorylation by each kinase provides a distinct functional consequence on the activity of Strap. ATM phosphorylation prompts nuclear accumulation, which we show occurs by impeding nuclear export, whereas Chk2 phosphorylation augments protein stability once Strap has attained a nuclear location. These results highlight the various functional roles undertaken by the DNA damage signalling kinases in Strap control and, more generally, shed light on the pathways that contribute to the regulation of the p53 response.","11":"SLP-76 and Cbl are complex adapter proteins that have the capacity to bind to smaller adapter proteins, such as Grb2, which subsequently binds the nucleotide exchange protein Sos in the transmission of intracellular signals. SLP-76, Cbl, Shc, and Grb2 have been implicated in immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) signaling, leading to activation of Ras. However, their mechanism of action has not been determined. To date, there have been no reports of SLP-76 involvement in FcgammaRI-receptor signaling and no data exist for an interaction between Cbl, Shc, and SLP-76 in vivo. We provide evidence that SLP-76, Cbl, and Shc are tyrosine phosphorylated on FcgammaRI-receptor stimulation and are associated with the adapter protein Grb2 in gamma-interferon-differentiated U937 cells (U937IF). The interactions between SLP-76 and Cbl and SLP-76 and Grb2 are present in resting U937IF cells. However, the interaction between SLP-76 and Grb2 becomes augmented twofold on FcgammaRI-receptor aggregation. Our results provide the first evidence for a phosphorylation-dependent interaction between SLP-76 and Shc, induced at least 10-fold on FcgammaRI receptor stimulation. Our data indicate that a significant portion of a multimolecular complex containing Cbl, SLP-76, Shc, and Grb2 is distinct from a trimolecular complex containing the Ras guanine nucleotide exchanger Sos, Shc, and Grb2. FcgammaRI-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of SLP-76, Cbl, Shc, and the highly induced SLP-76-Shc interaction provide the first evidence that SLP-76 and Cbl are involved in FcgammaRI signaling and suggest a functional significance for these interactions in FcgammaRI signal relay in the control of Ras in myeloid cells.","1240":"Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB)\/Rel transcription factors are key regulators of a variety of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and development. In unstimulated cells, NF-kappaB\/Rel proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm by IkappaB inhibitor proteins. Many extracellular stimuli, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), cause rapid phosphorylation of IkappaB at N-terminal serine residues leading to ubiquitination and degradation of the inhibitor. Subsequently, NF-kappaB proteins translocate to the nucleus and activate gene expression through kappaB response elements. TNFalpha, as well as certain other stimuli, also induces the phosphorylation of the NF-kappaB proteins. Previously, we have shown that TNFalpha induces RelA\/p65 phosphorylation at serine 529 and that this inducible phosphorylation increases NF-kappaB transcriptional activity on an exogenously supplied reporter (). In this report, we demonstrate that casein kinase II (CKII) interacts with p65 in vivo and can phosphorylate p65 at serine 529 in vitro. A CKII inhibitor (PD144795) inhibited TNFalpha-induced p65 phosphorylation in vivo. Furthermore, our results indicate that the association between IkappaBalpha and p65 inhibits p65 phosphorylation by CKII and that degradation of IkappaBalpha allows CKII to phosphorylate p65 to increase NF-kappaB transactivation potential. These data may explain the ability of CKII to modulate cell growth and demonstrate a mechanism whereby CKII can function in an inducible manner.","119":"Coactivator-associated arginine methyltransferase 1 (CARM1), a coactivator for various cancer-relevant transcription factors, is overexpressed in breast cancer. To elucidate the functions of CARM1 in tumorigenesis, we knocked out CARM1 from several breast cancer cell lines using Zinc-Finger Nuclease technology, which resulted in drastic phenotypic and biochemical changes. The CARM1 KO cell lines enabled identification of CARM1 substrates, notably the SWI\/SNF core subunit BAF155. Methylation of BAF155 at R1064 was found to be an independent prognostic biomarker for cancer recurrence and to regulate breast cancer cell migration and metastasis. Furthermore, CARM1-mediated BAF155 methylation affects gene expression by directing methylated BAF155 to unique chromatin regions (e.g., c-Myc pathway genes). Collectively, our studies uncover a mechanism by which BAF155 acquires tumorigenic functions via arginine methylation.","216":"Self-renewal of Bcr-Abl(+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells is sustained by a nuclear activated serine\/threonine-(S\/T) unphosphorylated beta-catenin. Although beta-catenin can be tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylated, the occurrence and biological relevance of this covalent modification in Bcr-Abl-associated leukemogenesis is unknown. Here we show that Bcr-Abl levels control the degree of beta-catenin protein stabilization by affecting its Y\/S\/T-phospho content in CML cells. Bcr-Abl physically interacts with beta-catenin, and its oncogenic tyrosine kinase activity is required to phosphorylate beta-catenin at Y86 and Y654 residues. This Y-phospho beta-catenin binds to the TCF4 transcription factor, thus representing a transcriptionally active pool. Imatinib, a Bcr-Abl antagonist, impairs the beta-catenin\/TCF-related transcription causing a rapid cytosolic retention of Y-unphosphorylated beta-catenin, which presents an increased binding affinity for the Axin\/GSK3beta complex. Although Bcr-Abl does not affect GSK3beta autophosphorylation, it prevents, through its effect on beta-catenin Y phosphorylation, Axin\/GSK3beta binding to beta-catenin and its subsequent S\/T phosphorylation. Silencing of beta-catenin by small interfering RNA inhibited proliferation and clonogenicity of Bcr-Abl(+) CML cells, in synergism with Imatinib. These findings indicate the Bcr-Abl triggered Y phosphorylation of beta-catenin as a new mechanism responsible for its protein stabilization and nuclear signalling activation in CML.","297":"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) triggers a signaling pathway converging on the activation of NF-kappaB, which forms the basis for many physiological and pathological processes. In a kinase gene screen using a NF-kappaB reporter, we observed that overexpression of casein kinase 1alpha (CK1alpha) enhanced TNFalpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, and a CK1alpha kinase dead mutant, CK1alpha (K46A), reduced NF-kappaB activation induced by TNFalpha. We subsequently demonstrated that CK1alpha interacted with receptor interacting protein 1 (RIP1) but not with TRADD, TRAF2, MEKK3, IKKalpha, IKKbeta, or IKKgamma in mammalian cells. RIP1 is an indispensable molecule in TNFalpha\/NF-kappaB signaling. We demonstrated that CK1alpha interacted with and phosphorylated RIP1 at the intermediate domain. Finally, we showed that CK1alpha enhanced RIP1-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Taken together, our studies suggest that CK1alpha is another kinase that regulates RIP1 function in NF-kappaB activation.","897":"To complete cell division with high fidelity, cytokinesis must be coordinated with chromosome segregation. Mammalian Polo-like kinase 1, Plk1, may function as a critical link because it is required for chromosome segregation and establishment of the cleavage plane following anaphase onset. A central spindle-localized pool of the RhoGEF Ect2 promotes activation of the small GTPase RhoA, which drives contractile ring assembly at the equatorial cortex. Here, we have investigated how Plk1 promotes the central spindle recruitment of Ect2. Plk1 phosphorylates the noncatalytic N terminus of the RhoGAP HsCyk-4 at the central spindle, creating a phospho-epitope recognized by the BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) repeats of Ect2. Failure to phosphorylate HsCyk-4 blocks Ect2 recruitment to the central spindle and the subsequent induction of furrowing. Microtubules, as well as the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) Prc1, facilitate Plk1 phosphorylation of HsCyk-4. Characterization of a phosphomimetic version of HsCyk-4 indicates that Plk1 promotes Ect2 recruitment through multiple targets. Collectively, our data reveal that formation of the HsCyk-4-Ect2 complex is subject to multiple layers of regulation to ensure that RhoA activation occurs between the segregated sister chromatids during anaphase.","489":"To gain insight into the function of human protein kinase X (PrKX), a signal-transduction protein required for macrophage differentiation, we identified regulatory subunit I alpha of protein kinase A, T54 and Smad6 as partners for this protein using a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen. Interactions between PrKX and these proteins were substantiated by co-immunoprecipitation. Interaction between Smad6 and PrKX was also confirmed in human myeloid HL-60 cells following their phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation into macrophages. In vitro phosphorylation assays demonstrated that PrKX phosphorylates Smad6 at a serine residue. Mutagenesis of this site resulted in abrogation of PrKX phosphorylation. Both PrKX and Smad6 were shown to be co-localized to the nuclear compartment of HL-60 cells during their macrophage differentiation where PrKX levels are induced and Smad6 protein levels remain relatively constant while levels of serine phosphorylation of Smad6 increase. By using in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation, we also demonstrate that during macrophage differentiation Smad6 displays an increased binding to the human osteopontin, Id2, and Hex gene promoters, which correlates to an observed increased expression of these genes. Finally, vector-based RNA interference experiments established that both Smad6 and PrKX proteins are required for PMA-induced cell attachment and spreading.","201":"TAK1 (transforming growth factor beta-activated kinase 1) is a serine\/threonine kinase that is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase and an essential intracellular signaling component in inflammatory signaling pathways. Upon stimulation of cells with inflammatory cytokines, TAK1 binds proteins that stimulate autophosphorylation within its activation loop and is thereby catalytically activated. This activation is transient; it peaks within a couple of minutes and is subsequently down-regulated rapidly to basal levels. The mechanism of down-regulation of TAK1 has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we found that toxin inhibition of type 2A protein phosphatases greatly enhances interleukin 1 (IL-1)-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-187 in the TAK1 activation loop as well as the catalytic activity of TAK1. From proteomic analysis of TAK1-binding proteins, we identified protein phosphatase 6 (PP6), a type-2A phosphatase, and demonstrated that PP6 associated with and inactivated TAK1 by dephosphorylation of Thr-187. Ectopic and endogenous PP6 co-precipitated with TAK1, and expression of PP6 reduced IL-1 activation of TAK1 but did not affect osmotic activation of MLK3, another MAPKKK. Reduction of PP6 expression by small interfering RNA enhances IL-1-induced phosphorylation of Thr-187 in TAK1. Enhancement occurred without change in levels of PP2A showing specificity for PP6. Our results demonstrate that PP6 specifically down-regulates TAK1 through dephosphorylation of Thr-187 in the activation loop, which is likely important for suppressing inflammatory responses via TAK1 signaling pathways.","1287":"A zinc finger protein, ZPR9, has been identified as a physiological substrate of murine protein serine\/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38), which is involved in various cellular responses, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, embryonic development, and oncogenesis. Here, ZPR9 was found to physically interact with apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) through a disulfide linkage involving Cys(1351) and Cys(1360) of ASK1 and Cys(305) and Cys(308) of ZPR9. ASK1 directly phosphorylated ZPR9 at Ser(314) and Thr(318), suggesting that ZPR9 can act as an ASK1 substrate. Ectopic expression of wild-type ZPR9, but not an S314A\/T318A mutant, stimulated ASK1 kinase activity and positively regulated ASK1-mediated signaling to both JNK and p38 kinases by destabilizing complex formation between ASK1 and its negative regulators, Trx and 14-3-3, or by increasing complex formation between ASK1 and its substrate MKK3. ZPR9 functionally stimulated ASK1-induced AP-1 transcriptional activity as well as H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. ASK1-mediated phosphorylation of ZPR9 at Ser(314) and Thr(318) was also responsible for ZPR9-induced apoptosis. Moreover, ZPR9 inhibited PDK1-mediated signaling through ASK1 activation. These results suggest that ZPR9 functions as a novel positive regulator of ASK1.","146":"Many proteins are known to promote ciliogenesis, but mechanisms that promote primary cilia disassembly before mitosis are largely unknown. Here we identify a mechanism that favours cilium disassembly and maintains the disassembled state. We show that co-localization of the S\/G2 phase kinase, Nek2 and Kif24 triggers Kif24 phosphorylation, inhibiting cilia formation. We show that Kif24, a microtubule depolymerizing kinesin, is phosphorylated by Nek2, which stimulates its activity and prevents the outgrowth of cilia in proliferating cells, independent of Aurora A and HDAC6. Our data also suggest that cilium assembly and disassembly are in dynamic equilibrium, but Nek2 and Kif24 can shift the balance toward disassembly. Further, Nek2 and Kif24 are overexpressed in breast cancer cells, and ablation of these proteins restores ciliation in these cells, thereby reducing proliferation. Thus, Kif24 is a physiological substrate of Nek2, which regulates cilia disassembly through a concerted mechanism involving Kif24-mediated microtubule depolymerization. ","903":"To complete cell division with high fidelity, cytokinesis must be coordinated with chromosome segregation. Mammalian Polo-like kinase 1, Plk1, may function as a critical link because it is required for chromosome segregation and establishment of the cleavage plane following anaphase onset. A central spindle-localized pool of the RhoGEF Ect2 promotes activation of the small GTPase RhoA, which drives contractile ring assembly at the equatorial cortex. Here, we have investigated how Plk1 promotes the central spindle recruitment of Ect2. Plk1 phosphorylates the noncatalytic N terminus of the RhoGAP HsCyk-4 at the central spindle, creating a phospho-epitope recognized by the BRCA1 C-terminal (BRCT) repeats of Ect2. Failure to phosphorylate HsCyk-4 blocks Ect2 recruitment to the central spindle and the subsequent induction of furrowing. Microtubules, as well as the microtubule-associated protein (MAP) Prc1, facilitate Plk1 phosphorylation of HsCyk-4. Characterization of a phosphomimetic version of HsCyk-4 indicates that Plk1 promotes Ect2 recruitment through multiple targets. Collectively, our data reveal that formation of the HsCyk-4-Ect2 complex is subject to multiple layers of regulation to ensure that RhoA activation occurs between the segregated sister chromatids during anaphase.","929":"Recent work has shown that the LKB1 tumour suppressor protein kinase phosphorylates and activates protein kinases belonging to the AMP activated kinase (AMPK) subfamily. In this study, we identify the sucrose non-fermenting protein (SNF1)-related kinase (SNRK), a largely unstudied AMPK subfamily member, as a novel substrate for LKB1. We demonstrate that LKB1 activates SNRK by phosphorylating the T-loop residue (Thr173), and that the LKB1 regulatory subunits STRAD and MO25 are required for LKB1 to activate SNRK. We find that SNRK is not active when expressed in HeLa cells that lack expression of LKB1, and its activity is restored by expression of wild type LKB1, but not catalytically deficient LKB1. We also present evidence that two other AMPK-related kinases more distantly related to AMPK than SNRK, namely NIM1 and testis-specific serine\/threonine kinase-1 (TSSK1) are not substrates for LKB1. Tissue distribution analysis indicates that SNRK protein is mainly expressed in testis, similar to TSSK isoforms, whereas NIM1 is more widely expressed. These results provide evidence that SNRK could mediate some of the physiological effects of LKB1.","751":"We used a substrate-trapping technique to search for substrates of protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) 1B. A catalytically inactive form of this enzyme forms a stable, phosphotyrosine-dependent complex with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) both in vitro and in cells. PTP1B also interacts with activated platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) but not with colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R). After binding to EGFR, PTP1B becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated at Tyr-66, a site that conforms to the consensus binding sequence for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the adapter protein Grb2. This tyrosine phosphorylation is correlated with a 3-fold increase in PTP catalytic activity. These findings suggest that PTP1B selectively regulates specific activated receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) in vivo and might itself be regulated by such receptors.","1010":"The tumor suppressor phosphatase PTEN is a key regulator of cell growth and apoptosis that interacts with PDZ domains from regulatory proteins, including MAGI-1\/2\/3, hDlg, and MAST205. Here we identified novel PTEN-binding PDZ domains within the MAST205-related proteins, syntrophin-associated serine\/threonine kinase and MAST3, characterized the regions of PTEN involved in its interaction with distinctive PDZ domains, and analyzed the functional consequences on PTEN of PDZ domain binding. Using a panel of PTEN mutations, as well as PTEN chimeras containing distinct domains of the related protein TPTE, we found that the PTP and C2 domains of PTEN do not affect PDZ domain binding and that the C-terminal tail of PTEN (residues 350-403) provides selectivity to recognize specific PDZ domains from MAGI-2, hDlg, and MAST205. Binding of PTEN to the PDZ-2 domain from MAGI-2 increased PTEN protein stability. Furthermore, binding of PTEN to the PDZ domains from microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases facilitated PTEN phosphorylation at its C terminus by these kinases. Our results suggest an important role for the C-terminal region of PTEN in the selective association with scaffolding and\/or regulatory molecules and provide evidence that PDZ domain binding stabilizes PTEN and targets this tumor suppressor for phosphorylation by microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases.","1155":"The activity of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) is restricted by their substrate specificities. The analysis of PTP specificity was greatly helped by the discovery that \"substrate-trapping\" PTP mutants, such as PTP-1B D181A, stably and specifically bind their substrates. We have set up a PTP substrate specificity assay based on the SPOT technique, which involves the microsynthesis of (phospho)peptides on membranes. To validate this approach, substrate trapping PTP-1B was tested on its cognate ligand, the autophosphorylated insulin receptor (IR). On SPOT membranes, IR peptides with phosphotyrosine 1163 were efficiently bound by PTP1B D181A, and dephosphorylated by PTP-1B. Phosphotyrosine 1163 was preferred over the neighboring 1158 and 1162 phosphotyrosines. PTP-1B also recognized IR-like motifs in Trk autophosphorylation domains, and STAT 5 phosphopeptides. Using a gridded 20-by-20 SPOT library, we show that peptides with the YZM motif (Z: phosphotyrosine) are the strongest ligands for PTP-1B D181A, but not the optimal substrates for dephosphorylation by wild-type PTP1B. In addition we show that PTP-1B and PTP-beta dephosphorylation efficiency is strongly modulated by the introduction of phospho-serine or phospho-threonine in their cognate phospho-tyrosine substrates. Altogether our data illustrate that the SPOT technique is a highly efficient tool for the study of PTP substrate specificity.","607":"In response to DNA double strand breaks, the histone variant H2AX at the break site is phosphorylated at serine 139 by DNA damage sensor kinases such as ataxia telangiectasia-mutated, forming gamma-H2AX. This phosphorylation event is critical for sustained recruitment of other proteins to repair the break. After repair, restoration of the cell to a prestress state is associated with gamma-H2AX dephosphorylation and dissolution of gamma-H2AX-associated damage foci. The phosphatases PP2A and PP4 have previously been shown to dephosphorylate gamma-H2AX. Here, we demonstrate that the wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (WIP1) also dephosphorylates gamma-H2AX at serine 139 in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of WIP1 reduces formation of gamma-H2AX foci in response to ionizing and ultraviolet radiation and blocks recruitment of MDC1 (mediator of DNA damage checkpoint 1) and 53BP1 (p53 binding protein 1) to DNA damage foci. Finally, these inhibitory effects of WIP1 on gamma-H2AX are accompanied by WIP1 suppression of DNA double strand break repair. Thus, WIP1 has a homeostatic role in reversing the effects of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated phosphorylation of H2AX.","618":"In response to DNA double strand breaks, the histone variant H2AX at the break site is phosphorylated at serine 139 by DNA damage sensor kinases such as ataxia telangiectasia-mutated, forming gamma-H2AX.

In this report we explore the effect of phosphorylation of cell division cycle 6 (Cdc6), a DNA replication initiation factor, by polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) on the regulation of chromosomal segregation. In mitosis, the phosphorylation of Cdc6 was highly increased, in correlation with the level of Plk1, and conversely, Cdc6 is hypophosphorylated in Plk1-depleted cells, although cyclin A- and cyclin B1-dependent kinases are active. Binding between Cdc6 and Plk1 occurs through the polo-box domain of Plk1, and Cdc6 is phosphorylated by Plk1 on T37. Immunohistochemistry studies reveal that Cdc6 and Plk1 colocalize to the central spindle in anaphase. Expression of T37V mutant of Cdc6 (Cdc6-TV) induces binucleated cells and incompletely separated nuclei. Wild-type Cdc6 but not Cdc6-TV binds cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). Expression of wild-type Plk1 but not kinase-defective mutant promotes the binding of Cdc6 to Cdk1. Cells expressing wild-type Cdc6 display lower Cdk1 activity and higher separase activity than cells expressing Cdc6-TV. These results suggest that Plk1-mediated phosphorylation of Cdc6 promotes the interaction of Cdc6 and Cdk1, leading to the attenuation of Cdk1 activity, release of separase, and subsequent anaphase progression.","525":"Stimulation of mature T cells activates a downstream signaling cascade involving temporally and spatially regulated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events mediated by protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, respectively. PTPN22 (Lyp), a non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase, is expressed exclusively in cells of hematopoietic origin, notably in T cells where it represses signaling through the T cell receptor. We used substrate trapping coupled with mass spectrometry-based peptide identification in an unbiased approach to identify physiological substrates of PTPN22. Several potential substrates were identified in lysates from pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells using PTPN22-D195A\/C227S, an optimized substrate trap mutant of PTPN22. These included three novel PTPN22 substrates (Vav, CD3epsilon, and valosin containing protein) and two known substrates of PEP, the mouse homolog of PTPN22 (Lck and Zap70). T cell antigen receptor (TCR) zeta was also identified as a potential substrate in Jurkat lysates by direct immunoblotting. In vitro experiments with purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that PTPN22-D195A\/C227S interacted directly with activated Lck, Zap70, and TCRzeta, confirming the initial substrate trap results. Native PTPN22 dephosphorylated Lck and Zap70 at their activating tyrosine residues Tyr-394 and Tyr-493, respectively, but not at the regulatory tyrosines Tyr-505 (Lck) or Tyr-319 (Zap70). Native PTPN22 also dephosphorylated TCRzeta in vitro and in cells, and its substrate trap variant co-immunoprecipitated with TCRzeta when both were coexpressed in 293T cells, establishing TCRzeta as a direct substrate of PTPN22.","1125":"Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins (SMC1, SMC3) are evolutionarily conserved chromosomal proteins that are components of the cohesin complex, necessary for sister chromatid cohesion. These proteins may also function in DNA repair. Here we report that SMC1 is a component of the DNA damage response network that functions as an effector in the ATM\/NBS1-dependent S-phase checkpoint pathway. SMC1 associates with BRCA1 and is phosphorylated in response to IR in an ATM- and NBS1-dependent manner. Using mass spectrometry, we established that ATM phosphorylates S957 and S966 of SMC1 in vivo. Phosphorylation of S957 and\/or S966 of SMC1 is required for activation of the S-phase checkpoint in response to IR. We also discovered that the phosphorylation of NBS1 by ATM is required for the phosphorylation of SMC1, establishing the role of NBS1 as an adaptor in the ATM\/NBS1\/SMC1 pathway. The ATM\/CHK2\/CDC25A pathway is also involved in the S-phase checkpoint activation, but this pathway is intact in NBS cells. Our results indicate that the ATM\/NBS1\/SMC1 pathway is a separate branch of the S-phase checkpoint pathway, distinct from the ATM\/CHK2\/CDC25A branch. Therefore, this work establishes the ATM\/NBS1\/SMC1 branch, and provides a molecular basis for the S-phase checkpoint defect in NBS cells.","1002":"The tumor suppressor phosphatase PTEN is a key regulator of cell growth and apoptosis that interacts with PDZ domains from regulatory proteins, including MAGI-1\/2\/3, hDlg, and MAST205. Here we identified novel PTEN-binding PDZ domains within the MAST205-related proteins, syntrophin-associated serine\/threonine kinase and MAST3, characterized the regions of PTEN involved in its interaction with distinctive PDZ domains, and analyzed the functional consequences on PTEN of PDZ domain binding. Using a panel of PTEN mutations, as well as PTEN chimeras containing distinct domains of the related protein TPTE, we found that the PTP and C2 domains of PTEN do not affect PDZ domain binding and that the C-terminal tail of PTEN (residues 350-403) provides selectivity to recognize specific PDZ domains from MAGI-2, hDlg, and MAST205. Binding of PTEN to the PDZ-2 domain from MAGI-2 increased PTEN protein stability. Furthermore, binding of PTEN to the PDZ domains from microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases facilitated PTEN phosphorylation at its C terminus by these kinases. Our results suggest an important role for the C-terminal region of PTEN in the selective association with scaffolding and\/or regulatory molecules and provide evidence that PDZ domain binding stabilizes PTEN and targets this tumor suppressor for phosphorylation by microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases.","456":"It is thought that G(1) cyclin\/CDK mediated phosphorylation of pocket proteins from mid G(1) to mitosis is reversed via dephosphorylation in mitosis. We examined the mechanisms involved in the unexpectedly rapid dephosphorylation of the pocket proteins induced via inhibition of cellular protein synthesis by cycloheximide (CHX) as well as direct inhibition of CDKs by flavopiridol. CHX and flavopiridol-induced dephosphorylation of pocket proteins is attributable to inactivation of D-type cyclin\/CDKs and G(1)\/S CDKs, respectively, which unmasks a phosphatase activity that targets the three pocket proteins apparently throughout the cell cycle. Treatment of cells with phosphatase inhibitors at concentrations selective for PP2A inhibition prevents CHX and flavopiridol-mediated dephosphorylation of pocket proteins in vivo. Also, ectopic expression of SV40 small t antigen, which inhibits PP2A via disruption of trimeric PP2A holoenzymes, delays CHX-induced pocket protein dephosphorylation. Moreover, dephosphorylation of p130 and p107 in cell extracts is inhibited by concentrations of okadaic acid known to inhibit PP2A, but not PP1. Finally, the PP2A catalytic subunit (PP2A\/C) specifically interacts with both p130 and p107 in quiescent cells as well as cells progressing throughout the cell cycle. Together, these results demonstrate that the overall phosphorylation state of pocket proteins is determined, at least in part, by a dynamic equilibrium between CDKs and PP2A, or a closely related PP2A-like enzyme. These findings have important implications, as cell cycle or checkpoint-dependent inhibition of CDK activities counteracted by an active PP2A should have imminent effects on the phosphorylation state and activities of pocket proteins.","448":"Aurora-C, a member of the Aurora kinase family that can complement Aurora-B function in mitosis is either moderately expressed or repressed in most adult somatic tissues but is active in early embryonic development and expressed at elevated levels in multiple human cancers. Aurora-C overexpression reportedly plays a role in tumorigenic transformation. We performed detailed characterization of Aurora-C interactions with members of the Chromosome Passenger Complex (CPC), Survivin and Inner Centromere Protein (INCENP) in reference to known Aurora-B interactions to understand the functional significance of Aurora-C overexpression in human cancer cells. The results revealed that silencing of Aurora-C or -B individually does not affect localization of the other kinase and the two kinases exist predominantly in independent complexes in vivo. Presence of Aurora-C and -B in molecular complexes of varying as well as overlapping sizes and co-existence in INCENP overexpressing cells indicated oligomerization of ternary complexes under different physiological conditions in vivo. Furthermore, Aurora-C and -B stabilized INCENP through interaction with and phosphorylation of the IN box domain while Aurora-C was activated following Survivin phosphorylation on Serine 20. Phosphorylation of Survivin residue Serine 20 by Aurora-C and -B appears important for proper chromosome segregation. Taken together, our study suggests that Aurora-C, expressed at low levels in somatic cells, functions as a catalytic component of the CPC together with Aurora-B through mitosis. Elevated expression of Aurora-C in cancer cells alters the structural and functional characteristics of the Aurora-B-CPC leading to chromosomal instability. ","912":"Animal cells initiate cytokinesis in parallel with anaphase onset, when an actomyosin ring assembles and constricts through localized activation of the small GTPase RhoA, giving rise to a cleavage furrow. Furrow formation relies on positional cues provided by anaphase spindle microtubules (MTs), but how such cues are generated remains unclear. Using chemical genetics to achieve both temporal and spatial control, we show that the self-organized delivery of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) to the midzone and its local phosphorylation of a MT-bound substrate are critical for generating this furrow-inducing signal. When Plk1 was active but unable to target itself to this equatorial landmark, both cortical RhoA recruitment and furrow induction failed to occur, thus recapitulating the effects of anaphase-specific Plk1 inhibition. Using tandem mass spectrometry and phosphospecific antibodies, we found that Plk1 binds and directly phosphorylates the HsCYK-4 subunit of centralspindlin (also known as MgcRacGAP) at the midzone. At serine 157, this modification creates a major docking site for the tandem BRCT repeats of the Rho GTP exchange factor Ect2. Cells expressing only a nonphosphorylatable form of HsCYK-4 failed to localize Ect2 at the midzone and were severely impaired in cleavage furrow formation, implying that HsCYK-4 is Plk1's rate-limiting target upstream of RhoA. Conversely, tethering an inhibitor-resistant allele of Plk1 to HsCYK-4 allowed furrows to form despite global inhibition of all other Plk1 molecules in the cell. Our findings illuminate two key mechanisms governing the initiation of cytokinesis in human cells and illustrate the power of chemical genetics to probe such regulation both in time and space.","1223":"The high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 proteins stimulate the ubiquitination and degradation of p53, dependent on the E6AP ubiquitin-protein ligase. Other proteins have also been shown to be targeted for degradation by E6, including hDlg, the human homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster Discs large (Dlg) tumor suppressor. We show here that the human homolog of the Drosophila Scribble (Vartul) (hScrib) tumor suppressor protein is also targeted for ubiquitination by the E6-E6AP complex in vitro and that expression of E6 induces degradation of hScrib in vivo. Characterization of the E6AP-E6-hScrib complex indicated that hScrib binds directly to E6 and that the binding is mediated by the PDZ domains of hScrib and a carboxyl-terminal epitope conserved among the high-risk HPV E6 proteins. Green fluorescent protein-hScrib was localized to the periphery of MDCK cells, where it colocalized with ZO-1, a component of tight junctions. E6 expression resulted in loss of integrity of tight junctions, as measured by ZO-1 localization, and this effect was dependent on the PDZ binding epitope of E6. Thus, the high-risk HPV E6 proteins induce the degradation of the human homologs of two Drosophila PDZ domain-containing tumor suppressor proteins, hDlg and hScrib, both of which are associated with cell junction complexes. The fact that Scrib\/Vart and Dlg appear to cooperate in a pathway that controls Drosophila epithelial cell growth suggests that the combined targeting of hScrib and hDlg is an important component of the biologic activity of high-risk HPV E6 proteins.","621":"AKT pathway has a critical role in mediating signaling transductions for cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Previous studies have shown that AKT activation is achieved through a series of phosphorylation steps: first, AKT is phosphorylated at Thr-450 by JNK kinases to prime its activation; then, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 phosphorylates AKT at Thr-308 to expose the Ser-473 residue; and finally, AKT is phosphorylated at Ser-473 by several kinases (PKD2 and others) to achieve its full activation. For its inactivation, the PH-domain containing phosphatases dephosphorylate AKT at Ser-473, and protein serine\/threonine phosphatase-2A (PP-2A) dephosphorylates it at Thr-308. However, it remains unknown regarding which phosphatase dephosphorylates AKT at Thr-450 during its inactivation. In this study, we present both in vitro and in vivo evidence to show that protein serine\/threonine phosphatase-1 (PP-1) is a major phosphatase that directly dephosphorylates AKT to modulate its activation. First, purified PP-1 directly dephosphorylates AKT in vitro. Second, immunoprecipitation and immunocolocalization showed that PP-1 interacts with AKT. Third, stable knock down of PP-1alpha or PP-1beta but not PP-1gamma, PP-2Aalpha or PP-2Abeta by shRNA leads to enhanced phosphorylation of AKT at Thr-450. Finally, overexpression of PP-1alpha or PP-1beta but not PP-1gamma, PP-2Aalpha or PP-2Abeta results in attenuated phosphorylation of AKT at Thr-450. Moreover, our results also show that dephosphorylation of AKT by PP-1 significantly modulates its functions in regulating the expression of downstream genes, promoting cell survival and modulating differentiation. These results show that PP-1 acts as a major phosphatase to dephosphorylate AKT at Thr-450 and thus modulate its functions.","512":"It has been shown that MDMX inhibits the activity of the tumor suppressor p53 by primarily cooperating with the p53 feedback regulator MDM2. Here, our study shows that this inhibition can be overcome by 14-3-3gamma and Chk1. 14-3-3gamma was identified as an MDMX-associated protein via an immuno-affinity purification-coupled mass spectrometry. Consistently, 14-3-3gamma directly interacted with MDMX in vitro, and this interaction was stimulated by MDMX phosphorylation in vitro and in cells. Interestingly, in response to UV irradiation, the wild-type, but not the kinase-dead mutant, Chk1 phosphorylated MDMX at serine 367, enhanced the 14-3-3gamma-MDMX binding and the cytoplasmic retaining of MDMX. The Chk1 specific inhibitor UCN-01 repressed all of these effects. Moreover, overexpression of 14-3-3gamma, but not its mutant K50E, which did not bind to MDMX, suppressed MDMX-enhanced p53 ubiquitination, leading to p53 stabilization and activation. Finally, ablation of 14-3-3gamma by siRNA reduced UV-induced p53 level and G1 arrest. Thus, these results demonstrate 14-3-3gamma and Chk1 as two novel regulators of MDMX in response to UV irradiation.","896":"To complete cell division with high fidelity, cytokinesis must be coordinated with chromosome segregation.

Previously, we have shown that human somatic Wee1 (Wee1A) is down-regulated both by protein phosphorylation and degradation, but the underlying mechanisms had not been elucidated. In the present study, we have identified the beta-transducin repeat-containing protein 1\/2 (beta-TrCP1\/2) F-box protein-containing SKP1\/Cul1\/F-box protein (SCF) complex (SCF(beta-TrCP1\/2)) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for Wee1A ubiquitination. Although Wee1A lacks a consensus DS(p)GXXS(p) phospho-dependent binding motif for beta-TrCP, recognition of Wee1A by beta-TrCP depended on phosphorylation, and two serine residues in Wee1A, S53 and S123, were found to be the most important phosphorylation sites for beta-TrCP recognition. We have found also that the major M-phase kinases polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and Cdc2 are responsible for the phosphorylation of S53 and S123, respectively, and that in each case phosphorylation generates an unconventional phospho-degron (signal for degradation) that can be recognized by beta-TrCP. Phosphorylation of Wee1A by these kinases cooperatively stimulated the recognition and ubiquitination of Wee1A by SCF(beta-TrCP1\/2) in vitro. Mutation of these residues or depletion of beta-TrCP by small-interfering RNA treatment increased the stability of Wee1A in HeLa cells. Moreover, our analysis indicates that beta-TrCP-dependent degradation of Wee1A is important for the normal onset of M-phase in vivo. These results also establish the existence of a feedback loop between Cdc2 and Wee1A in somatic cells that depends on ubiquitination and protein degradation and ensures the rapid activation of Cdc2 when cells are ready to divide.","221":"Protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is an ubiquitously expressed enzyme that negatively regulates growth-factor signalling and cell proliferation by binding to and dephosphorylating key receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the insulin receptor. It is unclear how the activity of PTP1B is regulated. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, a protein inhibitor of activated STAT1 (PIAS1) was isolated as a PTP1B-interacting protein. Here, we show that PIAS1, which functions as a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase, associates with PTP1B in mammalian fibroblasts and catalyses sumoylation of PTP1B. Sumoylation of PTP1B reduces its catalytic activity and inhibits the negative effect of PTP1B on insulin receptor signalling and on transformation by the oncogene v-crk. Insulin-stimulated sumoylation of endogenous PTP1B results in a transient downregulation of the enzyme; this event does not occur when the endogenous enzyme is replaced with a sumoylation-resistant mutant of PTP1B. These results suggest that sumoylation, which has been implicated primarily in processes in the nucleus and nuclear pore, also modulates a key enzyme-substrate signalling complex that regulates metabolism and cell proliferation.","823":"The activation of NF-kappaB has been shown to be regulated by multiple phosphorylations of IkappaBs and the NF-kappaB p65 subunit. Here, we characterized the intracellular signaling pathway leading to phosphorylation of p65 on Ser-536 using a novel anti-phospho-p65 (Ser-536) antibody. The Ser-536 of endogenous p65 was rapidly phosphorylated in response to a wide variety of NF-kappaB stimulants including TNF-alpha in the cytoplasm and rapidly dephosphorylated in the nucleus. The TNF-alpha-but not IL-1beta-induced Ser-536 phosphorylation was severely impaired in murine embryonic fibroblasts derived from traf2-\/-traf5-\/- mice. Bay 11-7082, an inhibitor of IkappaB phosphorylation, inhibited the TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation in vivo. In addition, overexpression of TGF-beta-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), IKKalpha and IKKbeta stimulated the phosphorylation, and their dominant negative mutants blocked the TNF-alpha-induced phosphorylation. Moreover, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against TAK1, IKKalpha and IKKbeta blocked the phosphorylation of endogenous p65. On the other hand, calyculin-A, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, blocked the dephosphorylation in the nucleus in vivo. These results indicate that similar signaling pathways were utilized for the phosphorylations of IkappaBalpha and p65, which further support the idea that both IkappaB and NF-kappaB are substrates for the IKK complex in the activation of NF-kappaB.","408":"Cyclin D-dependent kinases (CDK4 and CDK6) are positive regulators of cell cycle entry and they are overactive in the majority of human cancers. However, it is currently not completely understood by which cellular mechanisms CDK4\/6 promote tumorigenesis, largely due to the limited number of identified substrates. Here we performed a systematic screen for substrates of cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin D3-CDK6. We identified the Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) transcription factor as a common critical phosphorylation target. CDK4\/6 stabilize and activate FOXM1, thereby maintain expression of G1\/S phase genes, suppress the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and protect cancer cells from senescence. Melanoma cells, unlike melanocytes, are highly reliant on CDK4\/6-mediated senescence suppression, which makes them particularly susceptible to CDK4\/6 inhibition.","944":"Upon leptin binding, the leptin receptor is activated, leading to stimulation of the JAK\/STAT signal transduction cascade. The transient character of the tyrosine phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3 suggests the involvement of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) as negative regulators of this signalling pathway. Specifically, recent evidence has suggested that PTP1B might be a key regulator of leptin signalling, based on the resistance to diet-induced obesity and increased leptin signalling observed in PTP1B-deficient mice. The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism by which PTP1B mediates the cessation of the leptin signal transduction. Leptin-induced activation of a STAT3 responsive reporter was dose-dependently inhibited by co-transfection with PTP1B. No inhibition was observed when a catalytically inactive mutant of PTP1B was used or when other PTPs were co-transfected. PTP1B was able to dephosphorylate activated JAK2 and STAT3 in vitro, whereas either no or a minimal effect was observed with cluster of differentiation 45 (CD45), PTPalpha and leukocyte antigen-related (LAR). By utilisation of a selective PTP1B inhibitor, the leptin-induced STAT3 activation was enhanced in cells. In conclusion, these results suggested that the negative regulatory role of PTP1B on leptin signalling is mediated through a direct and selective dephosphorylation of the two signalling molecules, JAK2 and STAT3."},"annotations":{"680":[{"start":"0","end":"4","name":"Wee1","type":"Gene","normalised_id":"7465"},{"start":"10","end":"14","name":"Cdc2","type":"Gene","normalised_id":"983"},{"start":"115","end":"119","name":"Cdc2","type":"Gene","normalised_id":"983"},{"start":"152","end":"157","name":"human","type":"Species","normalised_id":"9606"},{"start":"166","end":"170","name":"Wee1","type":"Gene","normalised_id":"7465"},{"start":"172","end":"177","name":"Wee1A","type":"Gene","normalised_id":"7465"},{"start":"346","end":"391","name":"beta-transducin

the P06493 inhibitory kinase, needs to be down-regulated at the onset of mitosis to ensure rapid activation of P06493. Previously, we have shown that human somatic P30291 (P30291) is down-regulated both by protein phosphorylation and degradation, but the underlying mechanisms had not been elucidated. In the present study, we have identified the Q9UKB1 (Q9Y297) F-box protein-containing P63208\/Q13616\/F-box protein (P21583) complex (P21583(Q9Y297)) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for P30291 ubiquitination. Although P30291 lacks a consensus DS(p)GXXS(p) phospho-dependent binding motif for Q9Y297, recognition of P30291 by Q9Y297 depended on phosphorylation, and two serine residues in P30291, S53 and S123, were found to be the most important phosphorylation sites for Q9Y297 recognition. We have found also that the major M-phase kinases P53350 (P53350) and P06493 are responsible for the phosphorylation of S53 and S123, respectively, and that in each case phosphorylation generates an unconventional phospho-degron (signal for degradation) that can be recognized by Q9Y297. Phosphorylation of P30291 by these kinases cooperatively stimulated the recognition and ubiquitination of P30291 by P21583(Q9Y297) in vitro. Mutation of these residues or depletion of Q9Y297 by small-interfering RNA treatment increased the stability of P30291 in HeLa cells. Moreover, our analysis indicates that Q9Y297-dependent degradation of P30291 is important for the normal onset of M-phase in vivo. These results also establish the existence of a feedback loop between P06493 and P30291 in somatic cells that depends on ubiquitination and protein degradation and ensures the rapid activation of P06493 when cells are ready to divide.","656":"Q8NHY2 (Q8NHY2) is a RING-finger-containing protein that functions to repress plant photomorphogenesis, the light-mediated programme of plant development. Mutants of Q8NHY2 are constitutively photomorphogenic, and this has been attributed to their inability to negatively regulate the proteins LAF1 (ref. 1) and HY5 (ref. 2). The role of Q8NHY2 in mammalian cells is less well characterized. Here we identify the tumour-suppressor protein P04637 as a Q8NHY2-interacting protein. Q8NHY2 increases P04637 turnover by targeting it for degradation by the proteasome in a ubiquitin-dependent fashion, independently of Q00987 or Q96PM5, which are known to interact with and negatively regulate P04637. Moreover, Q8NHY2 serves as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for P04637 in vitro and in vivo, and inhibits P04637-dependent transcription and apoptosis. Depletion of Q8NHY2 by short interfering RNA (siRNA) stabilizes P04637 and arrests cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, we identify Q8NHY2 as a P04637-inducible gene, and show that the depletion of Q8NHY2 and Q00987 by siRNA cooperatively sensitizes U2-OS cells to ionizing-radiation-induced cell death. Overall, these results indicate that Q8NHY2 is a critical negative regulator of P04637 and represents a new pathway for maintaining P04637 at low levels in unstressed cells.","632":"P31749 pathway has a critical role in mediating signaling transductions for cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Previous studies have shown that P31749 activation is achieved through a series of phosphorylation steps: first, P31749 is phosphorylated at Thr-450 by JNK kinases to prime its activation; then, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 phosphorylates P31749 at Thr-308 to expose the Ser-473 residue; and finally, P31749 is phosphorylated at Ser-473 by several kinases (Q13563 and others) to achieve its full activation. For its inactivation, the PH-domain containing phosphatases dephosphorylate P31749 at Ser-473, and protein serine\/threonine Q15257 (Q15257) dephosphorylates it at Thr-308. However, it remains unknown regarding which phosphatase dephosphorylates P31749 at Thr-450 during its inactivation. In this study, we present both in vitro and in vivo evidence to show that Q15181) is a major phosphatase that directly dephosphorylates P31749 to modulate its activation. First, purified Q15181 directly dephosphorylates P31749 in vitro. Second, immunoprecipitation and immunocolocalization showed that Q15181 interacts with P31749. Third, stable knock down of P62136 or P62140 but not PP-1gamma, P67775 or P62714 by shRNA leads to enhanced phosphorylation of P31749 at Thr-450. Finally, overexpression of P62136 or P62140 but not PP-1gamma, P67775 or P62714 results in attenuated phosphorylation of P31749 at Thr-450. Moreover, our results also show that dephosphorylation of P31749 by Q15181 significantly modulates its functions in regulating the expression of downstream genes, promoting cell survival and modulating differentiation. These results show that Q15181 acts as a major phosphatase to dephosphorylate P31749 at Thr-450 and thus modulate its functions.","433":"Following genotoxic stress, cells activate a complex signalling network to arrest the cell cycle and initiate DNA repair or apoptosis. The tumour suppressor P04637 lies at the heart of this DNA damage response. However, it remains incompletely understood, which signalling molecules dictate the choice between these different cellular outcomes. Here, we identify the transcriptional regulator Q9NY61 (Q9NY61)\/Q9NY61 as a critical regulator of the cellular outcome of the P04637 response. Upon genotoxic stress, Q9NY61 is phosphorylated by the checkpoint kinase P49137. Phosphorylation results in the release of Q9NY61 from cytoplasmic P19105 and subsequent nuclear translocation where Q9NY61 binds to the Q96PG8, Q07812 and BAK promoter regions to repress P04637-driven expression of these pro-apoptotic genes. In xenograft experiments, mice exhibit a dramatically enhanced response of Q9NY61-depleted tumours following genotoxic chemotherapy with adriamycin. The exogenous expression of a phospho-mimicking Q9NY61 point mutant results in marked adriamycin resistance in vivo. Nuclear Q9NY61 enrichment appears to be selected for in P04637-proficient endometrial cancers. Furthermore, focal copy number gains at the Q9NY61 locus in neuroblastoma, which is known to be almost exclusively P04637-proficient, correlate with an adverse prognosis and reduced overall survival. These data identify the P28482\/P49137\/Q9NY61 signalling module as a critical repressor of P04637-driven apoptosis and commend this pathway as a target for DNA damage-sensitizing therapeutic regimens.","303":"P01375 (P01375) triggers a signaling pathway converging on the activation of P19838, which forms the basis for many physiological and pathological processes. In a kinase gene screen using a P19838 reporter, we observed that overexpression of casein kinase 1alpha (P48729) enhanced P01375-induced P19838 activation, and a P48729 kinase dead mutant, P48729 (K46A), reduced P19838 activation induced by P01375. We subsequently demonstrated that P48729 interacted with Q13546 (Q13546) but not with Q15628, Q12933, Q99759, O15111, O14920, or Q9Y6K9 in mammalian cells. Q13546 is an indispensable molecule in P01375\/P19838 signaling. We demonstrated that P48729 interacted with and phosphorylated Q13546 at the intermediate domain. Finally, we showed that P48729 enhanced Q13546-mediated P19838 activation. Taken together, our studies suggest that P48729 is another kinase that regulates Q13546 function in P19838 activation.","1261":"In an effort to clone novel tyrosine-phosphorylated substrates of the P00533, we have initiated an approach coupling affinity purification using anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies to mass spectrometry-based identification. Here, we report the identification of a signaling molecule containing a Src homology 3 domain as well as an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM). This molecule is 55% identical to a previously isolated molecule designated Q92783 (Q92783) that was identified as an interleukin (IL)-2-induced phosphoprotein and is therefore designated O75886. Tyrosine phosphorylation of O75886 is induced by growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and platelet-derived growth factor as well as by cytokines like P08700. Several of the deletion mutants tested except the one containing only the amino-terminal region underwent tyrosine phosphorylation upon growth factor stimulation, implying that O75886 is phosphorylated on several tyrosine residues. O75886 is downstream of the Jak family of kinases since coexpression of O75886 with P23458 or O60674 but not an unrelated Tec family kinase, P29320, resulted in its tyrosine phosphorylation. In contrast to P00533-induced phosphorylation, this required the ITAM domain since mutants lacking this region did not undergo tyrosine phosphorylation. Finally, overexpression of wild type O75886 led to an increase in P60568-mediated induction of P01106 promoter activation indicating that it potentiates cytokine receptor signaling.","509":"The protein phosphatase 2A (Q15257) acts on several kinases in the P28482 (P28482) signaling pathway but whether a specific holoenzyme dephosphorylates P28482 and whether this activity is controlled during mitogenic stimulation is unknown. By using both RNA interference and overexpression of Q15257 B regulatory subunits, we show that B56, but not B, family members of Q15257 increase P28482 dephosphorylation, without affecting its activation by MEK. Induction of the early gene product and P28482 substrate P46695) by growth factors leads to opposite effects and reverses B56-Q15257-mediated P28482 dephosphorylation. P46695 binds to B56 subunits and pERK independently, enhances B56 phosphorylation by P28482 at a conserved Ser\/Pro site in this complex and triggers dissociation from the catalytic subunit. This is the first demonstration of the involvement of B56-containing Q15257 in P28482 dephosphorylation and of a B56-specific cellular protein inhibitor regulating its activity in an P28482-dependent fashion. In addition, our results raise a new paradigm in P28482 signaling in which P28482 associated to a substrate can transphosphorylate nearby proteins.","763":"We used a substrate-trapping technique to search for substrates of P18031. A catalytically inactive form of this enzyme forms a stable, phosphotyrosine-dependent complex with P00533 (P00533) both in vitro and in cells. P18031 also interacts with activated P09619 (P09619) but not with P07333 (P07333). After binding to P00533, P18031 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated at Tyr-66, a site that conforms to the consensus binding sequence for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the adapter protein P62993. This tyrosine phosphorylation is correlated with a 3-fold increase in Q92729 catalytic activity. These findings suggest that P18031 selectively regulates specific activated receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) in vivo and might itself be regulated by such receptors.","952":"P31749\/protein kinase B is a major cell survival pathway through phosphorylation of proapoptotic proteins Q92934 and Q07812 and of additional apoptotic pathways linked to Forkhead proteins glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and Q99683. To further explore the mechanism by which P31749 regulates cell survival, we identified an P31749 interaction protein by yeast two-hybrid screening. It is highly homologous to O94875 (O94875) with splicing exon 8 of the coding region of the O94875. As two splicing isoforms (ArgBP2alpha and -beta) of O94875 have been identified (Wang, B., Golemis, E. A., and Kruh, G. D. (1997) J. Biol. Chem. 272, 17542-17550), it was named ArgBP2gamma. ArgBP2gamma contains four P31749 phosphorylation consensus sites, a SoHo motif, and three Src homology (SH) 3 domains and binds to C-terminal proline-rich motifs of P31749 through its first and second SH3 domains. It also interacts with 644914-activated protein kinase (Q13153) via its first and third SH3 domains, indicating the SH3 domains of ArgBP2gamma as docking sites for P31749 and Q13153. P31749 phosphorylates O94875gamma in vitro and in vivo. Expression of ArgBP2gamma induces Q13153 activity and overrides apoptosis induced by ectopic expression of Q92934 or DNA damage. Nonphosphorylatable ArgBP2gamma-4A and SH3 domain-truncated mutant ArgBP2gamma inhibit P31749-induced Q13153 activation and reduce P31749 and Q13153 phosphorylation of Q92934 and antiapoptotic function. These data indicate that ArgBP2gamma is a physiological substrate of P31749, functions as an adaptor for P31749 and Q13153, and plays a role in P31749\/Q13153 cell survival pathway.","484":"To gain insight into the function of human P51817 (P51817), a signal-transduction protein required for macrophage differentiation, we identified regulatory subunit I alpha of protein kinase A, Q92917 and O43541 as partners for this protein using a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen. Interactions between P51817 and these proteins were substantiated by co-immunoprecipitation. Interaction between O43541 and P51817 was also confirmed in human myeloid HL-60 cells following their phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation into macrophages. In vitro phosphorylation assays demonstrated that P51817 phosphorylates O43541 at a serine residue. Mutagenesis of this site resulted in abrogation of P51817 phosphorylation. Both P51817 and O43541 were shown to be co-localized to the nuclear compartment of HL-60 cells during their macrophage differentiation where P51817 levels are induced and O43541 protein levels remain relatively constant while levels of serine phosphorylation of O43541 increase. By using in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation, we also demonstrate that during macrophage differentiation O43541 displays an increased binding to the human P10451, Q02363, and Q03014 gene promoters, which correlates to an observed increased expression of these genes. Finally, vector-based RNA interference experiments established that both O43541 and P51817 proteins are required for PMA-induced cell attachment and spreading.","709":"Q12959, the human homologue of the Drosophila Discs-large (Q12959) tumor suppressor protein, is known to interact with the tumor suppressor protein APC and the human papillomavirus E6 transforming protein. In a two-hybrid screen, we identified a 322-aa serine\/threonine kinase that binds to the PDZ2 domain of Q12959. The mRNA for this Q96KB5, or Q96KB5, is most abundant in placenta and absent from adult brain tissue. The protein sequence of Q96KB5 has all the characteristic protein kinase subdomains and a C-terminal PDZ-binding T\/SXV motif. In vitro, Q96KB5 binds specifically to PDZ2 of Q12959 through its C-terminal T\/SXV motif. Q96KB5 and Q12959 are phosphorylated at mitosis in HeLa cells, and the mitotic phosphorylation of Q96KB5 is required for its kinase activity. In vitro, P06493\/cyclin B phosphorylates Q96KB5. This evidence shows how Q96KB5 could link Q12959 or other PDZ-containing proteins to signal transduction pathways regulating the cell cycle or cellular proliferation.","1113":"The breast cancer tumor-suppressor gene, P38398, encodes a protein with a BRCT domain-a motif that is found in many proteins that are implicated in DNA damage response and in genome stability. Phosphorylation of P38398 by the DNA damage-response proteins ATM, ATR and Q92903\/O96017 changes in response to DNA damage and at replication-block checkpoints. Although cells that lack P38398 have an abnormal response to DNA damage, the exact role of P38398 in this process has remained unclear. Here we show that P38398 is essential for activating the O14757 kinase that regulates DNA damage-induced G2\/M arrest. Thus, P38398 controls the expression, phosphorylation and cellular localization of P30307 and P06493\/cyclin B kinase-proteins that are crucial for the G2\/M transition. We show that P38398 regulates the expression of both P30291 kinase, an inhibitor of P06493\/cyclin B kinase, and the 14-3-3 family of proteins that sequesters phosphorylated P30307 and P06493\/cyclin B kinase in the cytoplasm. We conclude that P38398 regulates key effectors that control the G2\/M checkpoint and is therefore involved in regulating the onset of mitosis.","1290":"A zinc finger protein, Q969S3, has been identified as a physiological substrate of murine protein serine\/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38), which is involved in various cellular responses, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, embryonic development, and oncogenesis. Here, Q969S3 was found to physically interact with Q99683 (Q99683) through a disulfide linkage involving Cys(1351) and Cys(1360) of Q99683 and Cys(305) and Cys(308) of Q969S3. Q99683 directly phosphorylated Q969S3 at Ser(314) and Thr(318), suggesting that Q969S3 can act as an Q99683 substrate. Ectopic expression of wild-type Q969S3, but not an S314A\/T318A mutant, stimulated Q99683 kinase activity and positively regulated Q99683-mediated signaling to both JNK and Q16539 kinases by destabilizing complex formation between Q99683 and its negative regulators, Q08AM6, or by increasing complex formation between Q99683 and its substrate P46734. Q969S3 functionally stimulated Q99683-induced P01100 transcriptional activity as well as H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Q99683-mediated phosphorylation of Q969S3 at Ser(314) and Thr(318) was also responsible for Q969S3-induced apoptosis. Moreover, Q969S3 inhibited Q15118-mediated signaling through Q99683 activation. These results suggest that Q969S3 functions as a novel positive regulator of Q99683.","855":"Defining the links between cell division and DNA replication is essential for understanding normal cell cycle progression and tumorigenesis. In this report we explore the effect of phosphorylation of cell division cycle 6 (Q99741), a DNA replication initiation factor, by P53350 (P53350) on the regulation of chromosomal segregation. In mitosis, the phosphorylation of Q99741 was highly increased, in correlation with the level of P53350, and conversely, Q99741 is hypophosphorylated in P53350-depleted cells, although P20248- and P14635-dependent kinases are active. Binding between Q99741 and P53350 occurs through the polo-box domain of P53350, and Q99741 is phosphorylated by P53350 on T37. Immunohistochemistry studies reveal that Q99741 and P53350 colocalize to the central spindle in anaphase. Expression of T37V mutant of Q99741 (Q99741) induces binucleated cells and incompletely separated nuclei. Wild-type Q99741 but not Q99741 binds P06493 (P06493). Expression of wild-type P53350 but not kinase-defective mutant promotes the binding of Q99741 to P06493. Cells expressing wild-type Q99741 display lower P06493 activity and higher Q14674 activity than cells expressing Q99741. These results suggest that P53350-mediated phosphorylation of Q99741 promotes the interaction of Q99741 and P06493, leading to the attenuation of P06493 activity, release of Q14674, and subsequent anaphase progression.","1297":"A zinc finger protein, Q969S3, has been identified as a physiological substrate of murine protein serine\/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38), which is involved in various cellular responses, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, embryonic development, and oncogenesis.

Here, we show that Q8N0Z6 regulation reflects the coordinated interplay between different DNA damage-activated protein kinases, ATM and O96017 (O96017), where phosphorylation by each kinase provides a distinct functional consequence on the activity of Q8N0Z6. ATM phosphorylation prompts nuclear accumulation, which we show occurs by impeding nuclear export, whereas O96017 phosphorylation augments protein stability once Q8N0Z6 has attained a nuclear location. These results highlight the various functional roles undertaken by the DNA damage signalling kinases in Q8N0Z6 control and, more generally, shed light on the pathways that contribute to the regulation of the P04637 response.","11":"Q13094 and P22681 are complex adapter proteins that have the capacity to bind to smaller adapter proteins, such as P62993, which subsequently binds the nucleotide exchange protein Sos in the transmission of intracellular signals. Q13094, P22681, P29353, and P62993 have been implicated in immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) signaling, leading to activation of Ras. However, their mechanism of action has not been determined. To date, there have been no reports of Q13094 involvement in P12314-receptor signaling and no data exist for an interaction between P22681, P29353, and Q13094 in vivo. We provide evidence that Q13094, P22681, and P29353 are tyrosine phosphorylated on P12314-receptor stimulation and are associated with the adapter protein P62993 in gamma-interferon-differentiated U937 cells (U937IF). The interactions between Q13094 and P22681 and Q13094 and P62993 are present in resting U937IF cells. However, the interaction between Q13094 and P62993 becomes augmented twofold on P12314-receptor aggregation. Our results provide the first evidence for a phosphorylation-dependent interaction between Q13094 and P29353, induced at least 10-fold on P12314 receptor stimulation. Our data indicate that a significant portion of a multimolecular complex containing P22681, Q13094, P29353, and P62993 is distinct from a trimolecular complex containing the Ras guanine nucleotide exchanger Sos, P29353, and P62993. P12314-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Q13094, P22681, P29353, and the highly induced Q13094-P29353 interaction provide the first evidence that Q13094 and P22681 are involved in P12314 signaling and suggest a functional significance for these interactions in P12314 signal relay in the control of Ras in myeloid cells.","1240":"Nuclear factor kappaB (P19838)\/Q04864 transcription factors are key regulators of a variety of genes involved in immune and inflammatory responses, growth, differentiation, apoptosis, and development. In unstimulated cells, P19838\/Q04864 proteins are sequestered in the cytoplasm by IkappaB inhibitor proteins. Many extracellular stimuli, such as P01375 (P01375), cause rapid phosphorylation of IkappaB at N-terminal serine residues leading to ubiquitination and degradation of the inhibitor. Subsequently, P19838 proteins translocate to the nucleus and activate gene expression through kappaB response elements. P01375, as well as certain other stimuli, also induces the phosphorylation of the P19838 proteins. Previously, we have shown that P01375 induces Q04206\/Q04206 phosphorylation at serine 529 and that this inducible phosphorylation increases P19838 transcriptional activity on an exogenously supplied reporter (). In this report, we demonstrate that P68400 (P68400) interacts with Q04206 in vivo and can phosphorylate Q04206 at serine 529 in vitro. A P68400 inhibitor (PD144795) inhibited P01375-induced Q04206 phosphorylation in vivo. Furthermore, our results indicate that the association between P25963 and Q04206 inhibits Q04206 phosphorylation by P68400 and that degradation of P25963 allows P68400 to phosphorylate Q04206 to increase P19838 transactivation potential. These data may explain the ability of P68400 to modulate cell growth and demonstrate a mechanism whereby P68400 can function in an inducible manner.","119":"Q86X55 (Q86X55), a coactivator for various cancer-relevant transcription factors, is overexpressed in breast cancer. To elucidate the functions of Q86X55 in tumorigenesis, we knocked out Q86X55 from several breast cancer cell lines using Zinc-Finger Nuclease technology, which resulted in drastic phenotypic and biochemical changes. The Q86X55 KO cell lines enabled identification of Q86X55 substrates, notably the SWI\/SNF core subunit Q92922. Methylation of Q92922 at R1064 was found to be an independent prognostic biomarker for cancer recurrence and to regulate breast cancer cell migration and metastasis. Furthermore, Q86X55-mediated Q92922 methylation affects gene expression by directing methylated Q92922 to unique chromatin regions (e.g., P01106 pathway genes). Collectively, our studies uncover a mechanism by which Q92922 acquires tumorigenic functions via arginine methylation.","216":"Self-renewal of P00519(+) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cells is sustained by a nuclear activated serine\/threonine-(S\/T) unphosphorylated P35222. Although P35222 can be tyrosine (Y)-phosphorylated, the occurrence and biological relevance of this covalent modification in P00519-associated leukemogenesis is unknown. Here we show that P00519 levels control the degree of P35222 protein stabilization by affecting its Y\/S\/T-phospho content in CML cells. P00519 physically interacts with P35222, and its oncogenic tyrosine kinase activity is required to phosphorylate P35222 at Y86 and Y654 residues. This Y-phospho P35222 binds to the P15884 transcription factor, thus representing a transcriptionally active pool. Imatinib, a P00519 antagonist, impairs the P35222\/P41235-related transcription causing a rapid cytosolic retention of Y-unphosphorylated P35222, which presents an increased binding affinity for the O15169\/P49841 complex. Although P00519 does not affect P49841 autophosphorylation, it prevents, through its effect on P35222 Y phosphorylation, O15169\/P49841 binding to P35222 and its subsequent S\/T phosphorylation. Silencing of P35222 by small interfering RNA inhibited proliferation and clonogenicity of P00519(+) CML cells, in synergism with Imatinib. These findings indicate the P00519 triggered Y phosphorylation of P35222 as a new mechanism responsible for its protein stabilization and nuclear signalling activation in CML.","297":"P01375 (P01375) triggers a signaling pathway converging on the activation of P19838, which forms the basis for many physiological and pathological processes. In a kinase gene screen using a P19838 reporter, we observed that overexpression of casein kinase 1alpha (P48729) enhanced P01375-induced P19838 activation, and a P48729 kinase dead mutant, P48729 (K46A), reduced P19838 activation induced by P01375. We subsequently demonstrated that P48729 interacted with Q13546 (Q13546) but not with Q15628, Q12933, Q99759, O15111, O14920, or Q9Y6K9 in mammalian cells. Q13546 is an indispensable molecule in P01375\/P19838 signaling. We demonstrated that P48729 interacted with and phosphorylated Q13546 at the intermediate domain. Finally, we showed that P48729 enhanced Q13546-mediated P19838 activation. Taken together, our studies suggest that P48729 is another kinase that regulates Q13546 function in P19838 activation.","897":"To complete cell division with high fidelity, cytokinesis must be coordinated with chromosome segregation. Mammalian P53350, P53350, may function as a critical link because it is required for chromosome segregation and establishment of the cleavage plane following anaphase onset. A central spindle-localized pool of the RhoGEF Q9H8V3 promotes activation of the small GTPase P61586, which drives contractile ring assembly at the equatorial cortex. Here, we have investigated how P53350 promotes the central spindle recruitment of Q9H8V3. P53350 phosphorylates the noncatalytic N terminus of the RhoGAP Q9H0H5 at the central spindle, creating a phospho-epitope recognized by the P38398 C-terminal (BRCT) repeats of Q9H8V3. Failure to phosphorylate Q9H0H5 blocks Q9H8V3 recruitment to the central spindle and the subsequent induction of furrowing. Microtubules, as well as the Q96DB5 (Q96DB5) O43663, facilitate P53350 phosphorylation of Q9H0H5. Characterization of a phosphomimetic version of Q9H0H5 indicates that P53350 promotes Q9H8V3 recruitment through multiple targets. Collectively, our data reveal that formation of the Q9H0H5-Q9H8V3 complex is subject to multiple layers of regulation to ensure that P61586 activation occurs between the segregated sister chromatids during anaphase.","489":"To gain insight into the function of human P51817 (P51817), a signal-transduction protein required for macrophage differentiation, we identified regulatory subunit I alpha of protein kinase A, Q92917 and O43541 as partners for this protein using a yeast two-hybrid interaction screen. Interactions between P51817 and these proteins were substantiated by co-immunoprecipitation. Interaction between O43541 and P51817 was also confirmed in human myeloid HL-60 cells following their phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)-induced differentiation into macrophages. In vitro phosphorylation assays demonstrated that P51817 phosphorylates O43541 at a serine residue. Mutagenesis of this site resulted in abrogation of P51817 phosphorylation. Both P51817 and O43541 were shown to be co-localized to the nuclear compartment of HL-60 cells during their macrophage differentiation where P51817 levels are induced and O43541 protein levels remain relatively constant while levels of serine phosphorylation of O43541 increase. By using in vitro electrophoretic mobility shift assays and in vivo chromatin immunoprecipitation, we also demonstrate that during macrophage differentiation O43541 displays an increased binding to the human P10451, Q02363, and Q03014 gene promoters, which correlates to an observed increased expression of these genes. Finally, vector-based RNA interference experiments established that both O43541 and P51817 proteins are required for PMA-induced cell attachment and spreading.","201":"O43318 (O43318) is a serine\/threonine kinase that is a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase and an essential intracellular signaling component in inflammatory signaling pathways. Upon stimulation of cells with inflammatory cytokines, O43318 binds proteins that stimulate autophosphorylation within its activation loop and is thereby catalytically activated. This activation is transient; it peaks within a couple of minutes and is subsequently down-regulated rapidly to basal levels. The mechanism of down-regulation of O43318 has not yet been elucidated. In this study, we found that toxin inhibition of type 2A protein phosphatases greatly enhances interleukin 1 (IL-1)-dependent phosphorylation of Thr-187 in the O43318 activation loop as well as the catalytic activity of O43318. From proteomic analysis of O43318-binding proteins, we identified O00743 (O00743), a type-2A phosphatase, and demonstrated that O00743 associated with and inactivated O43318 by dephosphorylation of Thr-187. Ectopic and endogenous O00743 co-precipitated with O43318, and expression of O00743 reduced IL-1 activation of O43318 but did not affect osmotic activation of Q16584, another Q9Y6R4. Reduction of O00743 expression by small interfering RNA enhances IL-1-induced phosphorylation of Thr-187 in O43318. Enhancement occurred without change in levels of Q15257 showing specificity for O00743. Our results demonstrate that O00743 specifically down-regulates O43318 through dephosphorylation of Thr-187 in the activation loop, which is likely important for suppressing inflammatory responses via O43318 signaling pathways.","1287":"A zinc finger protein, Q969S3, has been identified as a physiological substrate of murine protein serine\/threonine kinase 38 (MPK38), which is involved in various cellular responses, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, embryonic development, and oncogenesis. Here, Q969S3 was found to physically interact with Q99683 (Q99683) through a disulfide linkage involving Cys(1351) and Cys(1360) of Q99683 and Cys(305) and Cys(308) of Q969S3. Q99683 directly phosphorylated Q969S3 at Ser(314) and Thr(318), suggesting that Q969S3 can act as an Q99683 substrate. Ectopic expression of wild-type Q969S3, but not an S314A\/T318A mutant, stimulated Q99683 kinase activity and positively regulated Q99683-mediated signaling to both JNK and Q16539 kinases by destabilizing complex formation between Q99683 and its negative regulators, Q08AM6, or by increasing complex formation between Q99683 and its substrate P46734. Q969S3 functionally stimulated Q99683-induced P01100 transcriptional activity as well as H(2)O(2)-mediated apoptosis in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Q99683-mediated phosphorylation of Q969S3 at Ser(314) and Thr(318) was also responsible for Q969S3-induced apoptosis. Moreover, Q969S3 inhibited Q15118-mediated signaling through Q99683 activation. These results suggest that Q969S3 functions as a novel positive regulator of Q99683.","146":"Many proteins are known to promote ciliogenesis, but mechanisms that promote primary cilia disassembly before mitosis are largely unknown. Here we identify a mechanism that favours cilium disassembly and maintains the disassembled state. We show that co-localization of the S\/G2 phase kinase, P51955 and Q5T7B8 triggers Q5T7B8 phosphorylation, inhibiting cilia formation. We show that Q5T7B8, a microtubule depolymerizing kinesin, is phosphorylated by P51955, which stimulates its activity and prevents the outgrowth of cilia in proliferating cells, independent of O14965 and Q9UBN7. Our data also suggest that cilium assembly and disassembly are in dynamic equilibrium, but P51955 and Q5T7B8 can shift the balance toward disassembly. Further, P51955 and Q5T7B8 are overexpressed in breast cancer cells, and ablation of these proteins restores ciliation in these cells, thereby reducing proliferation. Thus, Q5T7B8 is a physiological substrate of P51955, which regulates cilia disassembly through a concerted mechanism involving Q5T7B8-mediated microtubule depolymerization.

In this study, we identify the sucrose non-fermenting protein (SNF1)-related kinase (Q9NRH2), a largely unstudied AMPK subfamily member, as a novel substrate for Q15831. We demonstrate that Q15831 activates Q9NRH2 by phosphorylating the T-loop residue (Thr173), and that the Q15831 regulatory subunits Q7RTN6 and Q9Y376 are required for Q15831 to activate Q9NRH2. We find that Q9NRH2 is not active when expressed in HeLa cells that lack expression of Q15831, and its activity is restored by expression of wild type Q15831, but not catalytically deficient Q15831. We also present evidence that two other AMPK-related kinases more distantly related to AMPK than Q9NRH2, namely Q8IY84 and Q9BXA7 (Q9BXA7) are not substrates for Q15831. Tissue distribution analysis indicates that Q9NRH2 protein is mainly expressed in testis, similar to TSSK isoforms, whereas Q8IY84 is more widely expressed. These results provide evidence that Q9NRH2 could mediate some of the physiological effects of Q15831.","751":"We used a substrate-trapping technique to search for substrates of P18031. A catalytically inactive form of this enzyme forms a stable, phosphotyrosine-dependent complex with P00533 (P00533) both in vitro and in cells. P18031 also interacts with activated P09619 (P09619) but not with P07333 (P07333). After binding to P00533, P18031 becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated at Tyr-66, a site that conforms to the consensus binding sequence for the Src homology 2 (SH2) domains of the adapter protein P62993. This tyrosine phosphorylation is correlated with a 3-fold increase in Q92729 catalytic activity. These findings suggest that P18031 selectively regulates specific activated receptor protein tyrosine kinases (RPTKs) in vivo and might itself be regulated by such receptors.","1010":"The tumor suppressor phosphatase P60484 is a key regulator of cell growth and apoptosis that interacts with PDZ domains from regulatory proteins, including 9223;9863;260425, Q12959, and Q6P0Q8. Here we identified novel P60484-binding PDZ domains within the Q6P0Q8-related proteins, Q9Y2H9 and O60307, characterized the regions of P60484 involved in its interaction with distinctive PDZ domains, and analyzed the functional consequences on P60484 of PDZ domain binding. Using a panel of P60484 mutations, as well as P60484 chimeras containing distinct domains of the related protein P56180, we found that the PTP and C2 domains of P60484 do not affect PDZ domain binding and that the C-terminal tail of P60484 (residues 350-403) provides selectivity to recognize specific PDZ domains from Q86UL8, Q12959, and Q6P0Q8. Binding of P60484 to the PDZ-2 domain from Q86UL8 increased P60484 protein stability. Furthermore, binding of P60484 to the PDZ domains from microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases facilitated P60484 phosphorylation at its C terminus by these kinases. Our results suggest an important role for the C-terminal region of P60484 in the selective association with scaffolding and\/or regulatory molecules and provide evidence that PDZ domain binding stabilizes P60484 and targets this tumor suppressor for phosphorylation by microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases.","1155":"The activity of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) is restricted by their substrate specificities. The analysis of PTP specificity was greatly helped by the discovery that \"substrate-trapping\" PTP mutants, such as P18031 D181A, stably and specifically bind their substrates. We have set up a PTP substrate specificity assay based on the SPOT technique, which involves the microsynthesis of (phospho)peptides on membranes. To validate this approach, substrate trapping P18031 was tested on its cognate ligand, the autophosphorylated P06213 (P06213). On SPOT membranes, P06213 peptides with phosphotyrosine 1163 were efficiently bound by P18031 D181A, and dephosphorylated by P18031. Phosphotyrosine 1163 was preferred over the neighboring 1158 and 1162 phosphotyrosines. P18031 also recognized P06213-like motifs in Trk autophosphorylation domains, and P42229 phosphopeptides. Using a gridded 20-by-20 SPOT library, we show that peptides with the YZM motif (Z: phosphotyrosine) are the strongest ligands for P18031 D181A, but not the optimal substrates for dephosphorylation by wild-type P18031. In addition we show that P18031 and P23467 dephosphorylation efficiency is strongly modulated by the introduction of phospho-serine or phospho-threonine in their cognate phospho-tyrosine substrates. Altogether our data illustrate that the SPOT technique is a highly efficient tool for the study of PTP substrate specificity.","607":"In response to DNA double strand breaks, the histone variant P16104 at the break site is phosphorylated at serine 139 by DNA damage sensor kinases such as ataxia telangiectasia-mutated, forming gamma-P16104. This phosphorylation event is critical for sustained recruitment of other proteins to repair the break. After repair, restoration of the cell to a prestress state is associated with gamma-P16104 dephosphorylation and dissolution of gamma-P16104-associated damage foci. The phosphatases Q15257 and P60510 have previously been shown to dephosphorylate gamma-P16104. Here, we demonstrate that the O15297 (O15297) also dephosphorylates gamma-P16104 at serine 139 in vitro and in vivo. Overexpression of O15297 reduces formation of gamma-P16104 foci in response to ionizing and ultraviolet radiation and blocks recruitment of Q14676 (Q14676) and 53474256 (Q12888) to DNA damage foci. Finally, these inhibitory effects of O15297 on gamma-P16104 are accompanied by O15297 suppression of DNA double strand break repair. Thus, O15297 has a homeostatic role in reversing the effects of ataxia telangiectasia-mutated phosphorylation of P16104.","618":"In response to DNA double strand breaks, the histone variant P16104 at the break site is phosphorylated at serine 139 by DNA damage sensor kinases such as ataxia telangiectasia-mutated, forming gamma-P16104.

In this report we explore the effect of phosphorylation of cell division cycle 6 (Q99741), a DNA replication initiation factor, by P53350 (P53350) on the regulation of chromosomal segregation. In mitosis, the phosphorylation of Q99741 was highly increased, in correlation with the level of P53350, and conversely, Q99741 is hypophosphorylated in P53350-depleted cells, although P20248- and P14635-dependent kinases are active. Binding between Q99741 and P53350 occurs through the polo-box domain of P53350, and Q99741 is phosphorylated by P53350 on T37. Immunohistochemistry studies reveal that Q99741 and P53350 colocalize to the central spindle in anaphase. Expression of T37V mutant of Q99741 (Q99741) induces binucleated cells and incompletely separated nuclei. Wild-type Q99741 but not Q99741 binds P06493 (P06493). Expression of wild-type P53350 but not kinase-defective mutant promotes the binding of Q99741 to P06493. Cells expressing wild-type Q99741 display lower P06493 activity and higher Q14674 activity than cells expressing Q99741. These results suggest that P53350-mediated phosphorylation of Q99741 promotes the interaction of Q99741 and P06493, leading to the attenuation of P06493 activity, release of Q14674, and subsequent anaphase progression.","525":"Stimulation of mature T cells activates a downstream signaling cascade involving temporally and spatially regulated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events mediated by protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, respectively. Q9Y2R2 (Q9Y2R2), a non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase, is expressed exclusively in cells of hematopoietic origin, notably in T cells where it represses signaling through the T cell receptor. We used substrate trapping coupled with mass spectrometry-based peptide identification in an unbiased approach to identify physiological substrates of Q9Y2R2. Several potential substrates were identified in lysates from pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells using Q9Y2R2-D195A\/C227S, an optimized substrate trap mutant of Q9Y2R2. These included three novel Q9Y2R2 substrates (P15498, P07766, and P55072) and two known substrates of PEP, the mouse homolog of Q9Y2R2 (P06239 and P43403). 6962 (6962) zeta was also identified as a potential substrate in Jurkat lysates by direct immunoblotting. In vitro experiments with purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that Q9Y2R2-D195A\/C227S interacted directly with activated P06239, P43403, and TCRzeta, confirming the initial substrate trap results. Native Q9Y2R2 dephosphorylated P06239 and P43403 at their activating tyrosine residues Tyr-394 and Tyr-493, respectively, but not at the regulatory tyrosines Tyr-505 (P06239) or Tyr-319 (P43403). Native Q9Y2R2 also dephosphorylated TCRzeta in vitro and in cells, and its substrate trap variant co-immunoprecipitated with TCRzeta when both were coexpressed in 293T cells, establishing TCRzeta as a direct substrate of Q9Y2R2.","1125":"Structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins (Q14683, Q9UQE7) are evolutionarily conserved chromosomal proteins that are components of the cohesin complex, necessary for sister chromatid cohesion. These proteins may also function in DNA repair. Here we report that Q14683 is a component of the DNA damage response network that functions as an effector in the Q13315\/O60934-dependent S-phase checkpoint pathway. Q14683 associates with P38398 and is phosphorylated in response to IR in an Q13315- and O60934-dependent manner. Using mass spectrometry, we established that Q13315 phosphorylates S957 and S966 of Q14683 in vivo. Phosphorylation of S957 and\/or S966 of Q14683 is required for activation of the S-phase checkpoint in response to IR. We also discovered that the phosphorylation of O60934 by Q13315 is required for the phosphorylation of Q14683, establishing the role of O60934 as an adaptor in the Q13315\/O60934\/Q14683 pathway. The Q13315\/O96017\/P30304 pathway is also involved in the S-phase checkpoint activation, but this pathway is intact in NBS cells. Our results indicate that the Q13315\/O60934\/Q14683 pathway is a separate branch of the S-phase checkpoint pathway, distinct from the Q13315\/O96017\/P30304 branch. Therefore, this work establishes the Q13315\/O60934\/Q14683 branch, and provides a molecular basis for the S-phase checkpoint defect in NBS cells.","1002":"The tumor suppressor phosphatase P60484 is a key regulator of cell growth and apoptosis that interacts with PDZ domains from regulatory proteins, including 9223;9863;260425, Q12959, and Q6P0Q8.

Furthermore, binding of P60484 to the PDZ domains from microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases facilitated P60484 phosphorylation at its C terminus by these kinases. Our results suggest an important role for the C-terminal region of P60484 in the selective association with scaffolding and\/or regulatory molecules and provide evidence that PDZ domain binding stabilizes P60484 and targets this tumor suppressor for phosphorylation by microtubule-associated serine\/threonine kinases.","456":"It is thought that G(1) P12004\/CDK mediated phosphorylation of pocket proteins from mid G(1) to mitosis is reversed via dephosphorylation in mitosis. We examined the mechanisms involved in the unexpectedly rapid dephosphorylation of the pocket proteins induced via inhibition of cellular protein synthesis by cycloheximide (CHX) as well as direct inhibition of CDKs by flavopiridol. CHX and flavopiridol-induced dephosphorylation of pocket proteins is attributable to inactivation of D-type P12004\/CDKs and G(1)\/S CDKs, respectively, which unmasks a phosphatase activity that targets the three pocket proteins apparently throughout the cell cycle. Treatment of cells with phosphatase inhibitors at concentrations selective for Q15257 inhibition prevents CHX and flavopiridol-mediated dephosphorylation of pocket proteins in vivo. Also, ectopic expression of SV40 small t antigen, which inhibits Q15257 via disruption of trimeric Q15257 holoenzymes, delays CHX-induced pocket protein dephosphorylation. Moreover, dephosphorylation of Q08999 and P28749 in cell extracts is inhibited by concentrations of okadaic acid known to inhibit Q15257, but not Q15181. Finally, the P67775 (5515;5524) specifically interacts with both Q08999 and P28749 in quiescent cells as well as cells progressing throughout the cell cycle. Together, these results demonstrate that the overall phosphorylation state of pocket proteins is determined, at least in part, by a dynamic equilibrium between CDKs and Q15257, or a closely related Q15257-like enzyme. These findings have important implications, as cell cycle or checkpoint-dependent inhibition of CDK activities counteracted by an active Q15257 should have imminent effects on the phosphorylation state and activities of pocket proteins.","448":"Q9UQB9, a member of the Aurora kinase family that can complement Q96GD4 function in mitosis is either moderately expressed or repressed in most adult somatic tissues but is active in early embryonic development and expressed at elevated levels in multiple human cancers. Q9UQB9 overexpression reportedly plays a role in tumorigenic transformation. We performed detailed characterization of Q9UQB9 interactions with members of the Chromosome Passenger Complex (CPC), Survivin and Q9NQS7 (Q9NQS7) in reference to known Q96GD4 interactions to understand the functional significance of Q9UQB9 overexpression in human cancer cells. The results revealed that silencing of 6795;9212 individually does not affect localization of the other kinase and the two kinases exist predominantly in independent complexes in vivo. Presence of 6795;9212 in molecular complexes of varying as well as overlapping sizes and co-existence in Q9NQS7 overexpressing cells indicated oligomerization of ternary complexes under different physiological conditions in vivo. Furthermore, 6795;9212 stabilized Q9NQS7 through interaction with and phosphorylation of the IN box domain while Q9UQB9 was activated following Survivin phosphorylation on Serine 20. Phosphorylation of Survivin residue Serine 20 by 6795;9212 appears important for proper chromosome segregation. Taken together, our study suggests that Q9UQB9, expressed at low levels in somatic cells, functions as a catalytic component of the CPC together with Q96GD4 through mitosis. Elevated expression of Q9UQB9 in cancer cells alters the structural and functional characteristics of the Q96GD4-CPC leading to chromosomal instability. ","912":"Animal cells initiate cytokinesis in parallel with anaphase onset, when an actomyosin ring assembles and constricts through localized activation of the small GTPase P61586, giving rise to a cleavage furrow. Furrow formation relies on positional cues provided by anaphase spindle microtubules (MTs), but how such cues are generated remains unclear. Using chemical genetics to achieve both temporal and spatial control, we show that the self-organized delivery of P53350 (P53350) to the midzone and its local phosphorylation of a MT-bound substrate are critical for generating this furrow-inducing signal. When P53350 was active but unable to target itself to this equatorial landmark, both cortical P61586 recruitment and furrow induction failed to occur, thus recapitulating the effects of anaphase-specific P53350 inhibition. Using tandem mass spectrometry and phosphospecific antibodies, we found that P53350 binds and directly phosphorylates the Q9H0H5 subunit of centralspindlin (also known as Q9H0H5) at the midzone. At serine 157, this modification creates a major docking site for the tandem BRCT repeats of the Rho GTP exchange factor Q9H8V3. Cells expressing only a nonphosphorylatable form of Q9H0H5 failed to localize Q9H8V3 at the midzone and were severely impaired in cleavage furrow formation, implying that Q9H0H5 is P53350's rate-limiting target upstream of P61586. Conversely, tethering an inhibitor-resistant allele of P53350 to Q9H0H5 allowed furrows to form despite global inhibition of all other P53350 molecules in the cell. Our findings illuminate two key mechanisms governing the initiation of cytokinesis in human cells and illustrate the power of chemical genetics to probe such regulation both in time and space.","1223":"The high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 proteins stimulate the ubiquitination and degradation of P04637, dependent on the Q05086. Other proteins have also been shown to be targeted for degradation by E6, including Q12959, the human homolog of the Drosophila melanogaster Discs large (Q12959) tumor suppressor. We show here that the human homolog of the Drosophila Scribble (Q14160) (Q14160) tumor suppressor protein is also targeted for ubiquitination by the E6-E6AP complex in vitro and that expression of E6 induces degradation of Q14160 in vivo. Characterization of the E6AP-E6-Q14160 complex indicated that Q14160 binds directly to E6 and that the binding is mediated by the PDZ domains of Q14160 and a carboxyl-terminal epitope conserved among the high-risk HPV E6 proteins. Green fluorescent protein-Q14160 was localized to the periphery of MDCK cells, where it colocalized with Q07157, a component of tight junctions. E6 expression resulted in loss of integrity of tight junctions, as measured by Q07157 localization, and this effect was dependent on the PDZ binding epitope of E6. Thus, the high-risk HPV E6 proteins induce the degradation of the human homologs of two Drosophila PDZ domain-containing tumor suppressor proteins, Q12959 and Q14160, both of which are associated with cell junction complexes. The fact that Q14160\/Vart and Q12959 appear to cooperate in a pathway that controls Drosophila epithelial cell growth suggests that the combined targeting of Q14160 and Q12959 is an important component of the biologic activity of high-risk HPV E6 proteins.","621":"P31749 pathway has a critical role in mediating signaling transductions for cell proliferation, differentiation and survival. Previous studies have shown that P31749 activation is achieved through a series of phosphorylation steps: first, P31749 is phosphorylated at Thr-450 by JNK kinases to prime its activation; then, phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 phosphorylates P31749 at Thr-308 to expose the Ser-473 residue; and finally, P31749 is phosphorylated at Ser-473 by several kinases (Q13563 and others) to achieve its full activation. For its inactivation, the PH-domain containing phosphatases dephosphorylate P31749 at Ser-473, and protein serine\/threonine Q15257 (Q15257) dephosphorylates it at Thr-308. However, it remains unknown regarding which phosphatase dephosphorylates P31749 at Thr-450 during its inactivation. In this study, we present both in vitro and in vivo evidence to show that Q15181) is a major phosphatase that directly dephosphorylates P31749 to modulate its activation. First, purified Q15181 directly dephosphorylates P31749 in vitro. Second, immunoprecipitation and immunocolocalization showed that Q15181 interacts with P31749. Third, stable knock down of P62136 or P62140 but not PP-1gamma, P67775 or P62714 by shRNA leads to enhanced phosphorylation of P31749 at Thr-450. Finally, overexpression of P62136 or P62140 but not PP-1gamma, P67775 or P62714 results in attenuated phosphorylation of P31749 at Thr-450. Moreover, our results also show that dephosphorylation of P31749 by Q15181 significantly modulates its functions in regulating the expression of downstream genes, promoting cell survival and modulating differentiation. These results show that Q15181 acts as a major phosphatase to dephosphorylate P31749 at Thr-450 and thus modulate its functions.","512":"It has been shown that O15151 inhibits the activity of the tumor suppressor P04637 by primarily cooperating with the P04637 feedback regulator Q00987. Here, our study shows that this inhibition can be overcome by P61981 and O14757. P61981 was identified as an O15151-associated protein via an immuno-affinity purification-coupled mass spectrometry. Consistently, P61981 directly interacted with O15151 in vitro, and this interaction was stimulated by O15151 phosphorylation in vitro and in cells. Interestingly, in response to UV irradiation, the wild-type, but not the kinase-dead mutant, O14757 phosphorylated O15151 at serine 367, enhanced the P61981-O15151 binding and the cytoplasmic retaining of O15151. The O14757 specific inhibitor UCN-01 repressed all of these effects. Moreover, overexpression of P61981, but not its mutant K50E, which did not bind to O15151, suppressed O15151-enhanced P04637 ubiquitination, leading to P04637 stabilization and activation. Finally, ablation of P61981 by siRNA reduced UV-induced P04637 level and G1 arrest. Thus, these results demonstrate P61981 and O14757 as two novel regulators of O15151 in response to UV irradiation.","896":"To complete cell division with high fidelity, cytokinesis must be coordinated with chromosome segregation. Mammalian P53350, P53350, may function as a critical link because it is required for chromosome segregation and establishment of the cleavage plane following anaphase onset. A central spindle-localized pool of the RhoGEF Q9H8V3 promotes activation of the small GTPase P61586, which drives contractile ring assembly at the equatorial cortex. Here, we have investigated how P53350 promotes the central spindle recruitment of Q9H8V3. P53350 phosphorylates the noncatalytic N terminus of the RhoGAP Q9H0H5 at the central spindle, creating a phospho-epitope recognized by the P38398 C-terminal (BRCT) repeats of Q9H8V3. Failure to phosphorylate Q9H0H5 blocks Q9H8V3 recruitment to the central spindle and the subsequent induction of furrowing. Microtubules, as well as the Q96DB5 (Q96DB5) O43663, facilitate P53350 phosphorylation of Q9H0H5. Characterization of a phosphomimetic version of Q9H0H5 indicates that P53350 promotes Q9H8V3 recruitment through multiple targets. Collectively, our data reveal that formation of the Q9H0H5-Q9H8V3 complex is subject to multiple layers of regulation to ensure that P61586 activation occurs between the segregated sister chromatids during anaphase.","522":"Stimulation of mature T cells activates a downstream signaling cascade involving temporally and spatially regulated phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events mediated by protein-tyrosine kinases and phosphatases, respectively. Q9Y2R2 (Q9Y2R2), a non-receptor protein-tyrosine phosphatase, is expressed exclusively in cells of hematopoietic origin, notably in T cells where it represses signaling through the T cell receptor. We used substrate trapping coupled with mass spectrometry-based peptide identification in an unbiased approach to identify physiological substrates of Q9Y2R2. Several potential substrates were identified in lysates from pervanadate-stimulated Jurkat cells using Q9Y2R2-D195A\/C227S, an optimized substrate trap mutant of Q9Y2R2. These included three novel Q9Y2R2 substrates (P15498, P07766, and P55072) and two known substrates of PEP, the mouse homolog of Q9Y2R2 (P06239 and P43403). 6962 (6962) zeta was also identified as a potential substrate in Jurkat lysates by direct immunoblotting. In vitro experiments with purified recombinant proteins demonstrated that Q9Y2R2-D195A\/C227S interacted directly with activated P06239, P43403, and TCRzeta, confirming the initial substrate trap results. Native Q9Y2R2 dephosphorylated P06239 and P43403 at their activating tyrosine residues Tyr-394 and Tyr-493, respectively, but not at the regulatory tyrosines Tyr-505 (P06239) or Tyr-319 (P43403). Native Q9Y2R2 also dephosphorylated TCRzeta in vitro and in cells, and its substrate trap variant co-immunoprecipitated with TCRzeta when both were coexpressed in 293T cells, establishing TCRzeta as a direct substrate of Q9Y2R2.","675":"P30291, the P06493 inhibitory kinase, needs to be down-regulated at the onset of mitosis to ensure rapid activation of P06493. Previously, we have shown that human somatic P30291 (P30291) is down-regulated both by protein phosphorylation and degradation, but the underlying mechanisms had not been elucidated. In the present study, we have identified the Q9UKB1 (Q9Y297) F-box protein-containing P63208\/Q13616\/F-box protein (P21583) complex (P21583(Q9Y297)) as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for P30291 ubiquitination. Although P30291 lacks a consensus DS(p)GXXS(p) phospho-dependent binding motif for Q9Y297, recognition of P30291 by Q9Y297 depended on phosphorylation, and two serine residues in P30291, S53 and S123, were found to be the most important phosphorylation sites for Q9Y297 recognition. We have found also that the major M-phase kinases P53350 (P53350) and P06493 are responsible for the phosphorylation of S53 and S123, respectively, and that in each case phosphorylation generates an unconventional phospho-degron (signal for degradation) that can be recognized by Q9Y297. Phosphorylation of P30291 by these kinases cooperatively stimulated the recognition and ubiquitination of P30291 by P21583(Q9Y297) in vitro. Mutation of these residues or depletion of Q9Y297 by small-interfering RNA treatment increased the stability of P30291 in HeLa cells. Moreover, our analysis indicates that Q9Y297-dependent degradation of P30291 is important for the normal onset of M-phase in vivo. These results also establish the existence of a feedback loop between P06493 and P30291 in somatic cells that depends on ubiquitination and protein degradation and ensures the rapid activation of P06493 when cells are ready to divide.","221":"P18031 (P18031) is an ubiquitously expressed enzyme that negatively regulates growth-factor signalling and cell proliferation by binding to and dephosphorylating key receptor tyrosine kinases, such as the P06213. It is unclear how the activity of P18031 is regulated. Using a yeast two-hybrid assay, a protein inhibitor of activated P42224 (O75925) was isolated as a P18031-interacting protein. Here, we show that O75925, which functions as a small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) E3 ligase, associates with P18031 in mammalian fibroblasts and catalyses sumoylation of P18031. Sumoylation of P18031 reduces its catalytic activity and inhibits the negative effect of P18031 on P06213 signalling and on transformation by the oncogene v-crk. Insulin-stimulated sumoylation of endogenous P18031 results in a transient downregulation of the enzyme; this event does not occur when the endogenous enzyme is replaced with a sumoylation-resistant mutant of P18031. These results suggest that sumoylation, which has been implicated primarily in processes in the nucleus and nuclear pore, also modulates a key enzyme-substrate signalling complex that regulates metabolism and cell proliferation.","823":"The activation of P19838 has been shown to be regulated by multiple phosphorylations of IkappaBs and the P19838 Q04206 subunit. Here, we characterized the intracellular signaling pathway leading to phosphorylation of Q04206 on Ser-536 using a novel anti-phospho-Q04206 (Ser-536) antibody. The Ser-536 of endogenous Q04206 was rapidly phosphorylated in response to a wide variety of P19838 stimulants including P01375 in the cytoplasm and rapidly dephosphorylated in the nucleus. The P01375-but not P01584-induced Ser-536 phosphorylation was severely impaired in murine embryonic fibroblasts derived from traf2-\/-traf5-\/- mice. Bay 11-7082, an inhibitor of IkappaB phosphorylation, inhibited the P01375-induced phosphorylation in vivo. In addition, overexpression of O43318 (O43318), O15111 and O14920 stimulated the phosphorylation, and their dominant negative mutants blocked the P01375-induced phosphorylation. Moreover, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) against O43318, O15111 and O14920 blocked the phosphorylation of endogenous Q04206. On the other hand, calyculin-A, a protein phosphatase inhibitor, blocked the dephosphorylation in the nucleus in vivo. These results indicate that similar signaling pathways were utilized for the phosphorylations of P25963 and Q04206, which further support the idea that both IkappaB and P19838 are substrates for the IKK complex in the activation of P19838.","408":"Cyclin D-dependent kinases (P11802 and Q00534) are positive regulators of cell cycle entry and they are overactive in the majority of human cancers. However, it is currently not completely understood by which cellular mechanisms 1019;1021 promote tumorigenesis, largely due to the limited number of identified substrates. Here we performed a systematic screen for substrates of P24385-P11802 and P30281-Q00534. We identified the Q08050 (Q08050) transcription factor as a common critical phosphorylation target. 1019;1021 stabilize and activate Q08050, thereby maintain expression of G1\/S phase genes, suppress the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and protect cancer cells from senescence. Melanoma cells, unlike melanocytes, are highly reliant on 1019;1021-mediated senescence suppression, which makes them particularly susceptible to 1019;1021 inhibition.","944":"Upon P41159 binding, the P41159 receptor is activated, leading to stimulation of the JAK\/STAT signal transduction cascade. The transient character of the tyrosine phosphorylation of O60674 and P40763 suggests the involvement of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) as negative regulators of this signalling pathway. Specifically, recent evidence has suggested that P18031 might be a key regulator of P41159 signalling, based on the resistance to diet-induced obesity and increased P41159 signalling observed in P18031-deficient mice. The present study was undertaken to investigate the mechanism by which P18031 mediates the cessation of the P41159 signal transduction. P41159-induced activation of a P40763 responsive reporter was dose-dependently inhibited by co-transfection with P18031. No inhibition was observed when a catalytically inactive mutant of P18031 was used or when other PTPs were co-transfected. P18031 was able to dephosphorylate activated O60674 and P40763 in vitro, whereas either no or a minimal effect was observed with cluster of differentiation 45 (P08575), P18433 and P10586. By utilisation of a selective P18031 inhibitor, the P41159-induced P40763 activation was enhanced in cells. In conclusion, these results suggested that the negative regulatory role of P18031 on P41159 signalling is mediated through a direct and selective dephosphorylation of the two signalling molecules,
