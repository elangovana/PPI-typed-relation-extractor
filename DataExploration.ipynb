In addition, we found that hZIPK-S as well as hZIPK-L bind to myosin. These results indicate that a leucine zipper is not critical for the binding of ZIP kinase to MYPT1 and myosin. Consistently, hZIPK-S localized with stress-fibers where they co-localized with myosin. The residues 278-311, the C-terminal side of the kinase domain common to the both isoforms, is involved in the binding to MYPT1, while the myosin binding domain is within the kinase domain.

       "0  Zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIP kinase) has been thought to be involved in apoptosis and the C-terminal leucine zipper motif is important for its function. Recent studies have revealed that ZIP kinase also plays a role in regulating myosin phosphorylation. Here, we found novel ZIP kinase isoform in which the C-terminal non-kinase domain containing a leucine zipper is eliminated (hZIPK-S). hZIPK-S binds to myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1(MYPT1) similar to the long isoform (hZIPK-L). In addition, we found that hZIPK-S as well as hZIPK-L bind to myosin. These results indicate that a leucine zipper is not critical for the binding of ZIP kinase to MYPT1 and myosin. Consistently, hZIPK-S localized with stress-fibers where they co-localized with myosin. The residues 278-311, the C-terminal side of the kinase domain common to the both isoforms, is involved in the binding to MYPT1, while the myosin binding domain is within the kinase domain. These results suggest that the newly found hZIPK-S as well as the long isoform play an important role in the regulation of myosin phosphorylation.   \n",

Recent studies have revealed that ZIP kinase also plays a role in regulating myosin phosphorylation. Here, we found novel ZIP kinase isoform in which the C-terminal non-kinase domain containing a leucine zipper is eliminated (hZIPK-S). hZIPK-S binds to myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1(MYPT1) similar to the long isoform (hZIPK-L). In addition, we found that hZIPK-S as well as hZIPK-L bind to myosin. These results indicate that a leucine zipper is not critical for the binding of ZIP kinase to MYPT1 and myosin. Consistently, hZIPK-S localized with stress-fibers where they co-localized with myosin. The residues 278-311, the C-terminal side of the kinase domain common to the both isoforms, is involved in the binding to MYPT1, while the myosin binding domain is within the kinase domain. These results suggest that the newly found hZIPK-S as well as the long isoform play an important role in the regulation of myosin phosphorylation.</td>\n",

       "0  Zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIP kinase) has been thought to be involved in apoptosis and the C-terminal leucine zipper motif is important for its function. Recent studies have revealed that ZIP kinase also plays a role in regulating myosin phosphorylation. Here, we found novel ZIP kinase isoform in which the C-terminal non-kinase domain containing a leucine zipper is eliminated (hZIPK-S). hZIPK-S binds to myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1(MYPT1) similar to the long isoform (hZIPK-L). In addition, we found that hZIPK-S as well as hZIPK-L bind to myosin. These results indicate that a leucine zipper is not critical for the binding of ZIP kinase to MYPT1 and myosin. Consistently, hZIPK-S localized with stress-fibers where they co-localized with myosin. The residues 278-311, the C-terminal side of the kinase domain common to the both isoforms, is involved in the binding to MYPT1, while the myosin binding domain is within the kinase domain. These results suggest that the newly found hZIPK-S as well as the long isoform play an important role in the regulation of myosin phosphorylation.   \n",

Recent studies have revealed that O43293 also plays a role in regulating Q7Z406 phosphorylation. Here, we found novel O43293 isoform in which the C-terminal non-kinase domain containing a leucine zipper is eliminated (hZIPK-S). hZIPK-S binds to O14974(O14974) similar to the long isoform (hZIPK-L). In addition, we found that hZIPK-S as well as hZIPK-L bind to Q7Z406. These results indicate that a leucine zipper is not critical for the binding of O43293 to O14974 and Q7Z406. Consistently, hZIPK-S localized with stress-fibers where they co-localized with Q7Z406. The residues 278-311, the C-terminal side of the kinase domain common to the both isoforms, is involved in the binding to O14974, while the Q7Z406 binding domain is within the kinase domain. These results suggest that the newly found hZIPK-S as well as the long isoform play an important role in the regulation of Q7Z406 phosphorylation.</td>\n",

       "0  Zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIP kinase) has been thought to be involved in apoptosis and the C-terminal leucine zipper motif is important for its function. Recent studies have revealed that ZIP kinase also plays a role in regulating myosin phosphorylation. Here, we found novel ZIP kinase isoform in which the C-terminal non-kinase domain containing a leucine zipper is eliminated (hZIPK-S). hZIPK-S binds to myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1(MYPT1) similar to the long isoform (hZIPK-L). In addition, we found that hZIPK-S as well as hZIPK-L bind to myosin. These results indicate that a leucine zipper is not critical for the binding of ZIP kinase to MYPT1 and myosin. Consistently, hZIPK-S localized with stress-fibers where they co-localized with myosin. The residues 278-311, the C-terminal side of the kinase domain common to the both isoforms, is involved in the binding to MYPT1, while the myosin binding domain is within the kinase domain. These results suggest that the newly found hZIPK-S as well as the long isoform play an important role in the regulation of myosin phosphorylation.   \n",

       "0  Zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIP kinase) has been thought to be involved in apoptosis and the C-terminal leucine zipper motif is important for its function. Recent studies have revealed that ZIP kinase also plays a role in regulating myosin phosphorylation. Here, we found novel ZIP kinase isoform in which the C-terminal non-kinase domain containing a leucine zipper is eliminated (hZIPK-S). hZIPK-S binds to myosin phosphatase targeting subunit 1(MYPT1) similar to the long isoform (hZIPK-L). In addition, we found that hZIPK-S as well as hZIPK-L bind to myosin. These results indicate that a leucine zipper is not critical for the binding of ZIP kinase to MYPT1 and myosin. Consistently, hZIPK-S localized with stress-fibers where they co-localized with myosin. The residues 278-311, the C-terminal side of the kinase domain common to the both isoforms, is involved in the binding to MYPT1, while the myosin binding domain is within the kinase domain. These results suggest that the newly found hZIPK-S as well as the long isoform play an important role in the regulation of myosin phosphorylation.   \n",

Site-specific serine phosphorylation of IkappaBs by two IkappaB kinases (IKKalpha [also known as CHUK] and IKKbeta) targets them for proteolysis. IKKalpha and -beta have a unique structure, with an amino-terminal serine-threonine kinase catalytic domain and carboxy-proximal helix-loop-helix (HLH) and leucine zipper-like (LZip) amphipathic alpha-helical domains. Here, we describe the properties of two novel cellular isoforms of IKKalpha: IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH. IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH are differentially spliced isoforms of the IKKalpha mRNA lacking its HLH domain and both its LZip and HLH domains, respectively. IKKalpha is the major RNA species in most murine cells and tissues, except for activated T lymphocytes and the brain, where the alternatively spliced isoforms predominate. Remarkably, IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH, like IKKalpha, respond to tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulation to potentiate NF-kappaB activation in HEK293 cells. A mutant, catalytically inactive form of IKKalpha blocked IKKalpha-, IKKalpha-DeltaH-, and IKKalpha-DeltaLH-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Akin to IKKalpha, its carboxy-terminally truncated isoforms associated with the upstream activator NIK (NF-kappaB-inducing kinase). In contrast to IKKalpha, IKKalpha-DeltaLH failed to associate with either itself, IKKalpha, IKKbeta, or NEMO-IKKgamma-IKKAP1, while IKKalpha-DeltaH complexed with IKKbeta and IKKalpha but not with NEMO. Interestingly, each IKKalpha isoform rescued HEK293 cells from the inhibitory effects of a dominant-negative NEMO mutant, while IKKalpha could not. IKKalpha-DeltaCm, a recombinant mutant of IKKalpha structurally akin to IKKalpha-DeltaLH, was equally functional in these assays, but in sharp contrast, IKKbeta-DeltaCm, a structurally analogous mutant of IKKbeta, was inactive. Our results demonstrate that the functional roles of seemingly analogous domains in IKKalpha and IKKbeta need not be equivalent and can also exhibit different contextual dependencies. The existence of cytokine-inducible IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH isoforms illustrates potential modes of NF-kappaB activation, which are not subject to the same in vivo regulatory constraints as either IKKalpha or IKKbeta.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The activity of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors is regulated principally by phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of their inhibitory IkappaB subunits. Site-specific serine phosphorylation of IkappaBs by two IkappaB kinases (IKKalpha [also known as CHUK] and IKKbeta) targets them for proteolysis. IKKalpha and -beta have a unique structure, with an amino-terminal serine-threonine kinase catalytic domain and carboxy-proximal helix-loop-helix (HLH) and leucine zipper-like (LZip) amphipathic alpha-helical domains. Here, we describe the properties of two novel cellular isoforms of IKKalpha: IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH. IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH are differentially spliced isoforms of the IKKalpha mRNA lacking its HLH domain and both its LZip and HLH domains, respectively. IKKalpha is the major RNA species in most murine cells and tissues, except for activated T lymphocytes and the brain, where the alternatively spliced isoforms predominate. Remarkably, IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH, like IKKalpha, respond to tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulation to potentiate NF-kappaB activation in HEK293 cells. A mutant, catalytically inactive form of IKKalpha blocked IKKalpha-, IKKalpha-DeltaH-, and IKKalpha-DeltaLH-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Akin to IKKalpha, its carboxy-terminally truncated isoforms associated with the upstream activator NIK (NF-kappaB-inducing kinase). In contrast to IKKalpha, IKKalpha-DeltaLH failed to associate with either itself, IKKalpha, IKKbeta, or NEMO-IKKgamma-IKKAP1, while IKKalpha-DeltaH complexed with IKKbeta and IKKalpha but not with NEMO. Interestingly, each IKKalpha isoform rescued HEK293 cells from the inhibitory effects of a dominant-negative NEMO mutant, while IKKalpha could not. IKKalpha-DeltaCm, a recombinant mutant of IKKalpha structurally akin to IKKalpha-DeltaLH, was equally functional in these assays, but in sharp contrast, IKKbeta-DeltaCm, a structurally analogous mutant of IKKbeta, was inactive. Our results demonstrate that the functional roles of seemingly analogous domains in IKKalpha and IKKbeta need not be equivalent and can also exhibit different contextual dependencies. The existence of cytokine-inducible IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH isoforms illustrates potential modes of NF-kappaB activation, which are not subject to the same in vivo regulatory constraints as either IKKalpha or IKKbeta.</td>\n",

The use of immobilized proteins on protein chip as the library for screening of potential kinase substrates is a tried-and-tested method. However, information on phosphorylation sites is lacking and the creation of the library with proteins of whole proteome by recombinant expression is costly and difficult. In this study, a new solid-phase approach by immobilization of proteins from cell lysate onto beads as a protein library for kinase substrate screening was developed. It was found that consensus phosphorylation sites motif for kinase substrates could be accurately determined and hundreds of in vitro kinase substrates and their phosphorylation sites could be identified by using this method.   \n",

       "1059  The activity of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors is regulated principally by phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of their inhibitory IkappaB subunits. Site-specific serine phosphorylation of IkappaBs by two IkappaB kinases (IKKalpha [also known as CHUK] and IKKbeta) targets them for proteolysis. IKKalpha and -beta have a unique structure, with an amino-terminal serine-threonine kinase catalytic domain and carboxy-proximal helix-loop-helix (HLH) and leucine zipper-like (LZip) amphipathic alpha-helical domains. Here, we describe the properties of two novel cellular isoforms of IKKalpha: IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH. IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH are differentially spliced isoforms of the IKKalpha mRNA lacking its HLH domain and both its LZip and HLH domains, respectively. IKKalpha is the major RNA species in most murine cells and tissues, except for activated T lymphocytes and the brain, where the alternatively spliced isoforms predominate. Remarkably, IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH, like IKKalpha, respond to tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulation to potentiate NF-kappaB activation in HEK293 cells. A mutant, catalytically inactive form of IKKalpha blocked IKKalpha-, IKKalpha-DeltaH-, and IKKalpha-DeltaLH-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Akin to IKKalpha, its carboxy-terminally truncated isoforms associated with the upstream activator NIK (NF-kappaB-inducing kinase). In contrast to IKKalpha, IKKalpha-DeltaLH failed to associate with either itself, IKKalpha, IKKbeta, or NEMO-IKKgamma-IKKAP1, while IKKalpha-DeltaH complexed with IKKbeta and IKKalpha but not with NEMO. Interestingly, each IKKalpha isoform rescued HEK293 cells from the inhibitory effects of a dominant-negative NEMO mutant, while IKKalpha could not. IKKalpha-DeltaCm, a recombinant mutant of IKKalpha structurally akin to IKKalpha-DeltaLH, was equally functional in these assays, but in sharp contrast, IKKbeta-DeltaCm, a structurally analogous mutant of IKKbeta, was inactive. Our results demonstrate that the functional roles of seemingly analogous domains in IKKalpha and IKKbeta need not be equivalent and can also exhibit different contextual dependencies. The existence of cytokine-inducible IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH isoforms illustrates potential modes of NF-kappaB activation, which are not subject to the same in vivo regulatory constraints as either IKKalpha or IKKbeta.   \n",

However, it is currently not completely understood by which cellular mechanisms 1019;1021 promote tumorigenesis, largely due to the limited number of identified substrates. Here we performed a systematic screen for substrates of P24385-P11802 and P30281-Q00534. We identified the Q08050 (Q08050) transcription factor as a common critical phosphorylation target. 1019;1021 stabilize and activate Q08050, thereby maintain expression of G1/S phase genes, suppress the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and protect cancer cells from senescence. Melanoma cells, unlike melanocytes, are highly reliant on 1019;1021-mediated senescence suppression, which makes them particularly susceptible to 1019;1021 inhibition.   \n",

The use of immobilized proteins on protein chip as the library for screening of potential kinase substrates is a tried-and-tested method. However, information on phosphorylation sites is lacking and the creation of the library with proteins of whole proteome by recombinant expression is costly and difficult. In this study, a new solid-phase approach by immobilization of proteins from cell lysate onto beads as a protein library for kinase substrate screening was developed. It was found that consensus phosphorylation sites motif for kinase substrates could be accurately determined and hundreds of in vitro kinase substrates and their phosphorylation sites could be identified by using this method.   \n",

However, it is currently not completely understood by which cellular mechanisms 1019;1021 promote tumorigenesis, largely due to the limited number of identified substrates. Here we performed a systematic screen for substrates of P24385-P11802 and P30281-Q00534. We identified the Q08050 (Q08050) transcription factor as a common critical phosphorylation target. 1019;1021 stabilize and activate Q08050, thereby maintain expression of G1/S phase genes, suppress the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and protect cancer cells from senescence. Melanoma cells, unlike melanocytes, are highly reliant on 1019;1021-mediated senescence suppression, which makes them particularly susceptible to 1019;1021 inhibition.   \n",
       "1059  The activity of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors is regulated principally by phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of their inhibitory IkappaB subunits. Site-specific serine phosphorylation of IkappaBs by two IkappaB kinases (O15111 [also known as O15111] and O14920) targets them for proteolysis. 1147;3551 have a unique structure, with an amino-terminal serine-threonine kinase catalytic domain and carboxy-proximal helix-loop-helix (HLH) and leucine zipper-like (O43889) amphipathic alpha-helical domains. Here, we describe the properties of two novel cellular isoforms of O15111: O15111-DeltaH and O15111-DeltaLH. O15111-DeltaH and O15111-DeltaLH are differentially spliced isoforms of the O15111 mRNA lacking its HLH domain and both its O43889 and HLH domains, respectively. O15111 is the major RNA species in most murine cells and tissues, except for activated T lymphocytes and the brain, where the alternatively spliced isoforms predominate. Remarkably, O15111-DeltaH and O15111-DeltaLH, like O15111, respond to P01375 stimulation to potentiate NF-kappaB activation in HEK293 cells. A mutant, catalytically inactive form of O15111 blocked O15111-, O15111-DeltaH-, and O15111-DeltaLH-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Akin to O15111, its carboxy-terminally truncated isoforms associated with the upstream activator Q99558 (Q99558). In contrast to O15111, O15111-DeltaLH failed to associate with either itself, O15111, O14920, or Q9Y6K9-Q9Y6K9-Q9Y6K9, while O15111-DeltaH complexed with O14920 and O15111 but not with Q9Y6K9. Interestingly, each O15111 isoform rescued HEK293 cells from the inhibitory effects of a dominant-negative Q9Y6K9 mutant, while O15111 could not. O15111-DeltaCm, a recombinant mutant of O15111 structurally akin to O15111-DeltaLH, was equally functional in these assays, but in sharp contrast, O14920-DeltaCm, a structurally analogous mutant of O14920, was inactive. Our results demonstrate that the functional roles of seemingly analogous domains in O15111 and O14920 need not be equivalent and can also exhibit different contextual dependencies. The existence of cytokine-inducible O15111-DeltaH and O15111-DeltaLH isoforms illustrates potential modes of NF-kappaB activation, which are not subject to the same in vivo regulatory constraints as either O15111 or O14920.   \n",

However, it is currently not completely understood by which cellular mechanisms CDK4/6 promote tumorigenesis, largely due to the limited number of identified substrates. Here we performed a systematic screen for substrates of cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin D3-CDK6. We identified the Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) transcription factor as a common critical phosphorylation target. CDK4/6 stabilize and activate FOXM1, thereby maintain expression of G1/S phase genes, suppress the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and protect cancer cells from senescence. Melanoma cells, unlike melanocytes, are highly reliant on CDK4/6-mediated senescence suppression, which makes them particularly susceptible to CDK4/6 inhibition.   \n",

The use of immobilized proteins on protein chip as the library for screening of potential kinase substrates is a tried-and-tested method. However, information on phosphorylation sites is lacking and the creation of the library with proteins of whole proteome by recombinant expression is costly and difficult. In this study, a new solid-phase approach by immobilization of proteins from cell lysate onto beads as a protein library for kinase substrate screening was developed. It was found that consensus phosphorylation sites motif for kinase substrates could be accurately determined and hundreds of in vitro kinase substrates and their phosphorylation sites could be identified by using this method.   \n",

However, it is currently not completely understood by which cellular mechanisms CDK4/6 promote tumorigenesis, largely due to the limited number of identified substrates. Here we performed a systematic screen for substrates of cyclin D1-CDK4 and cyclin D3-CDK6. We identified the Forkhead Box M1 (FOXM1) transcription factor as a common critical phosphorylation target. CDK4/6 stabilize and activate FOXM1, thereby maintain expression of G1/S phase genes, suppress the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and protect cancer cells from senescence. Melanoma cells, unlike melanocytes, are highly reliant on CDK4/6-mediated senescence suppression, which makes them particularly susceptible to CDK4/6 inhibition.   \n",
       "1059  The activity of the NF-kappaB family of transcription factors is regulated principally by phosphorylation and subsequent degradation of their inhibitory IkappaB subunits. Site-specific serine phosphorylation of IkappaBs by two IkappaB kinases (IKKalpha [also known as CHUK] and IKKbeta) targets them for proteolysis. IKKalpha and -beta have a unique structure, with an amino-terminal serine-threonine kinase catalytic domain and carboxy-proximal helix-loop-helix (HLH) and leucine zipper-like (LZip) amphipathic alpha-helical domains. Here, we describe the properties of two novel cellular isoforms of IKKalpha: IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH. IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH are differentially spliced isoforms of the IKKalpha mRNA lacking its HLH domain and both its LZip and HLH domains, respectively. IKKalpha is the major RNA species in most murine cells and tissues, except for activated T lymphocytes and the brain, where the alternatively spliced isoforms predominate. Remarkably, IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH, like IKKalpha, respond to tumor necrosis factor alpha stimulation to potentiate NF-kappaB activation in HEK293 cells. A mutant, catalytically inactive form of IKKalpha blocked IKKalpha-, IKKalpha-DeltaH-, and IKKalpha-DeltaLH-mediated NF-kappaB activation. Akin to IKKalpha, its carboxy-terminally truncated isoforms associated with the upstream activator NIK (NF-kappaB-inducing kinase). In contrast to IKKalpha, IKKalpha-DeltaLH failed to associate with either itself, IKKalpha, IKKbeta, or NEMO-IKKgamma-IKKAP1, while IKKalpha-DeltaH complexed with IKKbeta and IKKalpha but not with NEMO. Interestingly, each IKKalpha isoform rescued HEK293 cells from the inhibitory effects of a dominant-negative NEMO mutant, while IKKalpha could not. IKKalpha-DeltaCm, a recombinant mutant of IKKalpha structurally akin to IKKalpha-DeltaLH, was equally functional in these assays, but in sharp contrast, IKKbeta-DeltaCm, a structurally analogous mutant of IKKbeta, was inactive. Our results demonstrate that the functional roles of seemingly analogous domains in IKKalpha and IKKbeta need not be equivalent and can also exhibit different contextual dependencies. The existence of cytokine-inducible IKKalpha-DeltaH and IKKalpha-DeltaLH isoforms illustrates potential modes of NF-kappaB activation, which are not subject to the same in vivo regulatory constraints as either IKKalpha or IKKbeta.   \n",

Upon ligand binding, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor (Met) is polyubiquitinated and degraded; however, the mechanisms underlying HGF receptor endocytosis are not yet known. Here we demonstrate that a complex involving endophilins, CIN85 and Cbl controls this process. Endophilins are regulatory components of clathrin-coated vesicle formation. Through their acyl-transferase activity they are thought to modify the membrane phospholipids and induce negative curvature and invagination of the plasma membrane during the early steps of endocytosis. Furthermore, by means of their Src-homology 3 domains, endophilins are able to bind CIN85, a recently identified protein that interacts with the Cbl proto-oncogene. Cbl, in turn, binds and ubiquitinates activated HGF receptor, and by recruiting the endophilin-CIN85 complex, it regulates receptor internalization. Inhibition of complex formation is sufficient to block HGF receptor internalization and to enhance HGF-induced signal transduction and biological responses. These data provide further evidence of a relationship between receptor-mediated signalling and endocytosis, and disclose a novel functional role for Cbl in HGF receptor signalling.</td>\n",

Cbl, in turn, binds and ubiquitinates activated HGF receptor, and by recruiting the endophilin-CIN85 complex, it regulates receptor internalization. Inhibition of complex formation is sufficient to block HGF receptor internalization and to enhance HGF-induced signal transduction and biological responses.

Here, we report a novel function of Src kinases as a negative regulator of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) dependent cell survival. We characterized a series of PDGF alpha receptor (PDGFRA) mutants, which lack the binding sites for Src, phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase (PI3K), SHP-2 or phospholipase C-gamma. We found that PDGFRA-dependent cell survival was mainly mediated through activation of PI3K, and was negatively regulated by Src. Characterization of the downstream signaling events revealed that PI3K activates the protein kinase Akt, which in turn phosphorylates and thus inactivates proapoptotic Forkhead transcription factors. Src phosphorylates the ubiquitin-ligase c-Cbl, which is required for degradation of the activated receptor. Consequently, overexpression of c-Cbl prevented PDGFRA-mediated cell survival, whereas it did not affect this response, when Src was unable to associate with the receptor.

       "0  Regulation of growth factor dependent cell survival is crucial for development and disease progression. Here, we report a novel function of P12931 kinases as a negative regulator of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) dependent cell survival. We characterized a series of PDGF alpha receptor (P16234) mutants, which lack the binding sites for P12931, P48736 (P48736), Q06124 or phospholipase C-gamma. We found that P16234-dependent cell survival was mainly mediated through activation of P48736, and was negatively regulated by P12931. Characterization of the downstream signaling events revealed that P48736 activates the protein kinase Akt, which in turn phosphorylates and thus inactivates proapoptotic Forkhead transcription factors. P12931 phosphorylates the ubiquitin-ligase P22681, which is required for degradation of the activated receptor. Consequently, overexpression of P22681 prevented P16234-mediated cell survival, whereas it did not affect this response, when P12931 was unable to associate with the receptor. This novel function of P12931 in antiapoptotic signaling introduces P12931 kinases as an interesting therapeutic target in apoptosis related diseases.   \n",

Serum/glucocorticoid-induced kinase (SGK) is an immediate early gene whose expression is induced by a variety of extra-cellular stimuli. Here, we examine the possibility that SGK can directly phosphorylate the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB). In a cell-free context, SGK physically associates with CREB and SGK phosphorylates it on serine 133. Phospho-serine 133 is essential for stimulating the transcriptional activity of CREB. Further, we show that in a variety of cellular contexts, SGK phosphorylates CREB. Activation of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways or the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) lead to SGK-dependent CREB phosphorylation. Hormonal stimulation of epithelial cells leads to the induction of endogenous SGK and CREB phosphorylation. A dominant-negative form of SGK blocks dexamethasone-induced CREB phosphorylation. Our studies indicate that stimulation of SGK can lead to CREB phosphorylation, suggesting that CREB-dependent gene transcription is an important link between stressful extra-cellular signals and cellular responses.</td>\n",

Our studies indicate that stimulation of O00141 can lead to P16220 phosphorylation, suggesting that P16220-dependent gene transcription is an important link between stressful extra-cellular signals and cellular responses.</td>\n",

We report here that fibroblasts isolated from LS patients displayed stronger epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced phosphorylation of both AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) than fibroblasts from control patients. Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells expressing LS mutants of SHP2. We found that the GAB1/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex was more abundant in fibroblasts from LS than control subjects and that both AKT and GSK-3beta hyperphosphorylation were prevented by reducing GAB1 expression or by overexpressing a GAB1 mutant unable to bind to PI3K. Consistently, purified recombinant LS mutants failed to dephosphorylate GAB1 PI3K-binding sites. These mutants induced PI3K-dependent increase in cell size in a model of chicken embryo cardiac explants and in transcriptional activity of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene in neonate rat cardiomyocytes.

Serum/glucocorticoid-induced kinase (SGK) is an immediate early gene whose expression is induced by a variety of extra-cellular stimuli. Here, we examine the possibility that SGK can directly phosphorylate the transcription factor cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB). In a cell-free context, SGK physically associates with CREB and SGK phosphorylates it on serine 133. Phospho-serine 133 is essential for stimulating the transcriptional activity of CREB. Further, we show that in a variety of cellular contexts, SGK phosphorylates CREB. Activation of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways or the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) lead to SGK-dependent CREB phosphorylation. Hormonal stimulation of epithelial cells leads to the induction of endogenous SGK and CREB phosphorylation. A dominant-negative form of SGK blocks dexamethasone-induced CREB phosphorylation. Our studies indicate that stimulation of SGK can lead to CREB phosphorylation, suggesting that CREB-dependent gene transcription is an important link between stressful extra-cellular signals and cellular responses.   \n",

Among 31 PTPs tested, T cell (TC)-PTP, PTP-beta, PTP1B, stomach cancer-associated PTP 1 (SAP-1), Pyst-2, Meg-2, and PTP-H1 showed specificity for phosphorylated GHR that had been produced by coexpression with a kinase in bacteria. We then used GH-induced, phosphorylated GH receptor, purified from overexpressing mammalian cells, in a Far Western-based approach to test whether these seven PTPs were also capable of recognizing ligand-induced, physiologically phosphorylated GHR. In this assay, only TC-PTP, PTP1B, PTP-H1, and SAP-1 interacted with the mature form of the phosphorylated GHR. In parallel, we show that these PTPs recognize very different subsets of the seven GHR tyrosines that are potentially phosphorylated. Finally, mRNA tissue distribution of these PTPs by RT-PCR analysis and coexpression of the wild-type PTPs to test their ability to dephosphorylate ligand-activated GHR suggest PTP-H1 and PTP1B as potential candidates involved in GHR signaling.   \n",

       "129  LEOPARD syndrome (LS), a disorder with multiple developmental abnormalities, is mainly due to mutations that impair the activity of the tyrosine phosphatase SHP2 (PTPN11). How these alterations cause the disease remains unknown. We report here that fibroblasts isolated from LS patients displayed stronger epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced phosphorylation of both AKT and glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK-3beta) than fibroblasts from control patients. Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells expressing LS mutants of SHP2. We found that the GAB1/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) complex was more abundant in fibroblasts from LS than control subjects and that both AKT and GSK-3beta hyperphosphorylation were prevented by reducing GAB1 expression or by overexpressing a GAB1 mutant unable to bind to PI3K. Consistently, purified recombinant LS mutants failed to dephosphorylate GAB1 PI3K-binding sites. These mutants induced PI3K-dependent increase in cell size in a model of chicken embryo cardiac explants and in transcriptional activity of the atrial natriuretic factor (ANF) gene in neonate rat cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, SHP2 mutations causing LS facilitate EGF-induced PI3K/AKT/GSK-3beta stimulation through impaired GAB1 dephosphorylation, resulting in deregulation of a novel signaling pathway that could be involved in LS pathology.   \n",

O00141 (O00141) is an immediate early gene whose expression is induced by a variety of extra-cellular stimuli. Here, we examine the possibility that O00141 can directly phosphorylate the transcription factor P16220 (P16220). In a cell-free context, O00141 physically associates with P16220 and O00141 phosphorylates it on serine 133. Phospho-serine 133 is essential for stimulating the transcriptional activity of P16220. Further, we show that in a variety of cellular contexts, O00141 phosphorylates P16220. Activation of receptor tyrosine kinase pathways or the Q15118 (Q15118) lead to O00141-dependent P16220 phosphorylation. Hormonal stimulation of epithelial cells leads to the induction of endogenous O00141 and P16220 phosphorylation. A dominant-negative form of O00141 blocks dexamethasone-induced P16220 phosphorylation. Our studies indicate that stimulation of O00141 can lead to P16220 phosphorylation, suggesting that P16220-dependent gene transcription is an important link between stressful extra-cellular signals and cellular responses.   \n",
       "175                      Protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) play key roles in switching off tyrosine phosphorylation cascades, such as initiated by cytokine receptors. We have used substrate-trapping mutants of a large set of PTPs to identify members of the PTP family that have substrate specificity for the phosphorylated human P10912 (P10912) intracellular domain. Among 31 PTPs tested, P17706, P23467, P18031, Q9HD43 (Q9HD43), Q16829, P43378, and P26045 showed specificity for phosphorylated P10912 that had been produced by coexpression with a kinase in bacteria. We then used GH-induced, phosphorylated P10912, purified from overexpressing mammalian cells, in a Far Western-based approach to test whether these seven PTPs were also capable of recognizing ligand-induced, physiologically phosphorylated P10912. In this assay, only P17706, P18031, P26045, and Q9HD43 interacted with the mature form of the phosphorylated P10912. In parallel, we show that these PTPs recognize very different subsets of the seven P10912 tyrosines that are potentially phosphorylated. Finally, mRNA tissue distribution of these PTPs by RT-PCR analysis and coexpression of the wild-type PTPs to test their ability to dephosphorylate ligand-activated P10912 suggest P26045 and P18031 as potential candidates involved in P10912 signaling.   \n",

       "129  LEOPARD syndrome (LS), a disorder with multiple developmental abnormalities, is mainly due to mutations that impair the activity of the tyrosine phosphatase Q06124 (Q06124). How these alterations cause the disease remains unknown. We report here that fibroblasts isolated from LS patients displayed stronger epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced phosphorylation of both P31749 and P49841 (P49841) than fibroblasts from control patients. Similar results were obtained in HEK293 cells expressing LS mutants of Q06124. We found that the P42338 (P42338) complex was more abundant in fibroblasts from LS than control subjects and that both P31749 and P49841 hyperphosphorylation were prevented by reducing Q13480 expression or by overexpressing a Q13480 mutant unable to bind to P42338. Consistently, purified recombinant LS mutants failed to dephosphorylate Q13480 P42338-binding sites. These mutants induced P42338-dependent increase in cell size in a model of chicken embryo cardiac explants and in transcriptional activity of the P01160 (P01160) gene in neonate rat cardiomyocytes. In conclusion, Q06124 mutations causing LS facilitate EGF-induced P42338/P31749/P49841 stimulation through impaired Q13480 dephosphorylation, resulting in deregulation of a novel signaling pathway that could be involved in LS pathology.   \n",

Here we report that the tyrosine phosphatase HD-PTP has a role in modulating the motility of T24 bladder carcinoma cells. Indeed, HD-PTP silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) markedly induced cell migration in a Src dependent fashion. We therefore investigated the interaction and the regulation of Src and HD-PTP. We found that, in Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) stimulated cells, Src binds to and phosphorylates HD-PTP on tyrosine residues. On the contrary, HD-PTP does not modulate the levels of Src phosphorylation. Interestingly, HD-PTP also binds to FAK, another regulator of cell migration, and this interaction is inhibited after exposure to EGF. FAK phosphorylates HD-PTP and this event reduced the interactions between the two proteins. Interestingly, in cells silencing HD-PTP the phosphorylation of FAK is enhanced and this correlates with its localization in focal complexes both in the presence and in the absence of EGF. We hypothesize that in unstimulated T24 cells HD-PTP does not interact with Src, while it binds to FAK. Following stimulation with EGF, HD-PTP is tyrosine-phosphorylated and releases FAK which will ultimately contribute to the turn-over of focal adhesion and, therefore, to cell motility.</td>\n",

Here we show that PTP1B regulates leptin signaling. In transfection studies, PTP1B dephosphorylates the leptin receptor-associated kinase, Jak2. PTP1B is expressed in hypothalamic regions harboring leptin-responsive neurons. Compared to wild-type littermates, PTP1B(-/-) mice have decreased leptin/body fat ratios, leptin hypersensitivity, and enhanced leptin-induced hypothalamic Stat3 tyrosyl phosphorylation.

Here we show that P18031 regulates leptin signaling. In transfection studies, P18031 dephosphorylates the leptin receptor-associated kinase, O60674. P18031 is expressed in hypothalamic regions harboring leptin-responsive neurons. Compared to wild-type littermates, P18031(-/-) mice have decreased leptin/body fat ratios, leptin hypersensitivity, and enhanced leptin-induced hypothalamic P40763 tyrosyl phosphorylation. Gold thioglucose treatment, which ablates leptin-responsive hypothalamic neurons, partially overcomes resistance to obesity in P18031(-/-) mice.

The putative Akt phosphorylation sites in Carma1 are distinct from known PKC consensus sites. Mutation of S551, S637 and S645 in Carma1 to non-phosphorylatable residues decreased phosphorylation of GST-Carma1-linker construct by Akt in vitro. In addition, Carma1 S637A/S645A mutants were significantly impaired in their ability to restore TCR-mediated NF-κB activation and IL-2 expression in Carma1-deficient T cells. Thus, our data reveal Carma1 as a novel target for Akt phosphorylation and suggest that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Carma1 is an additional regulatory mechanism tuning the NF-κB response downstream of antigen receptor and co-stimulatory signaling.</td>\n",

Active ERK2 docking to the DEF motif (FXFP, residues 339-342) of N-terminally truncated MKP-1 in vitro initiated phosphorylation at the Ser(296)/Ser(323) domain, which was not affected by substituting Ala for Ser at Ser(359)/Ser(364).

ERK activation by serum increased the endogenous level of ubiquitinated phospho-Ser(296) MKP-1 and the degradation of MKP-1. Intriguingly, active ERK-promoted phospho-Ser(296) MKP-1 bound to SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase in vivo and in vitro.

MgcRacGAP interacts with MKLP1 to form the centralspindlin complex and associates with the RhoGEF Ect2. The GAP activity of MgcRacGAP is regulated by Aurora B phosphorylation. We have isolated B56epsilon, a PP2A regulatory subunit, as a new MgcRacGAP partner. We report here that (i) MgcRacGAP is phosphorylated by Aurora B and Cdk1, (ii) PP2A dephosphorylates Aurora B and Cdk1 phosphorylated sites and (iii) inhibition of PP2A abrogates MgcRacGAP/Ect2 interaction. Therefore, PP2A may regulate cytokinesis by dephosphorylating MgcRacGAP and its interacting partners.   \n",
       "28                                          Cell migration is fundamental for invasion and metastasis and is modulated by the reversible phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on target proteins. Here we report that the tyrosine phosphatase HD-PTP has a role in modulating the motility of T24 bladder carcinoma cells. Indeed, HD-PTP silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) markedly induced cell migration in a Src dependent fashion. We therefore investigated the interaction and the regulation of Src and HD-PTP. We found that, in Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) stimulated cells, Src binds to and phosphorylates HD-PTP on tyrosine residues. On the contrary, HD-PTP does not modulate the levels of Src phosphorylation. Interestingly, HD-PTP also binds to FAK, another regulator of cell migration, and this interaction is inhibited after exposure to EGF. FAK phosphorylates HD-PTP and this event reduced the interactions between the two proteins. Interestingly, in cells silencing HD-PTP the phosphorylation of FAK is enhanced and this correlates with its localization in focal complexes both in the presence and in the absence of EGF. We hypothesize that in unstimulated T24 cells HD-PTP does not interact with Src, while it binds to FAK. Following stimulation with EGF, HD-PTP is tyrosine-phosphorylated and releases FAK which will ultimately contribute to the turn-over of focal adhesion and, therefore, to cell motility.   \n",

However, the molecular basis for resistance to obesity has been unclear. Here we show that PTP1B regulates leptin signaling. In transfection studies, PTP1B dephosphorylates the leptin receptor-associated kinase, Jak2. PTP1B is expressed in hypothalamic regions harboring leptin-responsive neurons. Compared to wild-type littermates, PTP1B(-/-) mice have decreased leptin/body fat ratios, leptin hypersensitivity, and enhanced leptin-induced hypothalamic Stat3 tyrosyl phosphorylation. Gold thioglucose treatment, which ablates leptin-responsive hypothalamic neurons, partially overcomes resistance to obesity in PTP1B(-/-) mice. Our data indicate that PTP1B regulates leptin signaling in vivo, likely by targeting Jak2. PTP1B may be a novel target to treat leptin resistance in obesity.   \n",

However, the direct targets of Akt in this pathway are not known. Here we show that Akt-mediated NF-κB activation is mediated at least in part through direct phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Carma1, which we previously demonstrated could interact with Akt in a TCR ligation-dependent manner. The putative Akt phosphorylation sites in Carma1 are distinct from known PKC consensus sites. Mutation of S551, S637 and S645 in Carma1 to non-phosphorylatable residues decreased phosphorylation of GST-Carma1-linker construct by Akt in vitro. In addition, Carma1 S637A/S645A mutants were significantly impaired in their ability to restore TCR-mediated NF-κB activation and IL-2 expression in Carma1-deficient T cells. Thus, our data reveal Carma1 as a novel target for Akt phosphorylation and suggest that Akt-mediated phosphorylation of Carma1 is an additional regulatory mechanism tuning the NF-κB response downstream of antigen receptor and co-stimulatory signaling.   \n",
       "14  The dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase MKP-1/CL100/DUSP1 is an inducible nuclear protein controlled by p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) in a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit kinase activity. Here, we report on the molecular basis for a novel positive feedback mechanism to sustain ERK activation by triggering MKP-1 proteolysis. Active ERK2 docking to the DEF motif (FXFP, residues 339-342) of N-terminally truncated MKP-1 in vitro initiated phosphorylation at the Ser(296)/Ser(323) domain, which was not affected by substituting Ala for Ser at Ser(359)/Ser(364). The DEF and Ser(296)/Ser(323) sites were essential for ubiquitin-mediated MKP-1 proteolysis stimulated by MKK1-ERK signaling in H293 cells, whereas the N-terminal domain and Ser(359)/Ser(364) sites were dispensable. ERK activation by serum increased the endogenous level of ubiquitinated phospho-Ser(296) MKP-1 and the degradation of MKP-1. Intriguingly, active ERK-promoted phospho-Ser(296) MKP-1 bound to SCF(Skp2) ubiquitin ligase in vivo and in vitro. Forced expression of Skp2 enhanced MKP-1 polyubiquitination and proteolysis upon ERK activation, whereas depletion of endogenous Skp2 suppressed such events. The kinetics of ERK signaling stimulated by serum correlated with the endogenous MKP-1 degradation rate in a Skp2-dependent manner. Thus, MKP-1 proteolysis can be achieved via ERK and SCF(Skp2) cooperation, thereby sustaining ERK activation.   \n",

Q9H0H5 interacts with Q02241 to form the centralspindlin complex and associates with the RhoGEF Q9H8V3. The GAP activity of Q9H0H5 is regulated by Q96GD4 phosphorylation. We have isolated B56epsilon, a Q15257 regulatory subunit, as a new Q9H0H5 partner. We report here that (i) Q9H0H5 is phosphorylated by Q96GD4 and P06493, (ii) Q15257 dephosphorylates Q96GD4 and P06493 phosphorylated sites and (iii) inhibition of Q15257 abrogates Q9H0H5/Q9H8V3 interaction. Therefore, Q15257 may regulate cytokinesis by dephosphorylating Q9H0H5 and its interacting partners.   \n",
       "28                                                  Cell migration is fundamental for invasion and metastasis and is modulated by the reversible phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on target proteins. Here we report that the tyrosine phosphatase Q9H3S7 has a role in modulating the motility of T24 bladder carcinoma cells. Indeed, Q9H3S7 silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) markedly induced cell migration in a P12931 dependent fashion. We therefore investigated the interaction and the regulation of P12931 and Q9H3S7. We found that, in Epidermal Growth Factor (EGF) stimulated cells, P12931 binds to and phosphorylates Q9H3S7 on tyrosine residues. On the contrary, Q9H3S7 does not modulate the levels of P12931 phosphorylation. Interestingly, Q9H3S7 also binds to Q05397, another regulator of cell migration, and this interaction is inhibited after exposure to EGF. Q05397 phosphorylates Q9H3S7 and this event reduced the interactions between the two proteins. Interestingly, in cells silencing Q9H3S7 the phosphorylation of Q05397 is enhanced and this correlates with its localization in focal complexes both in the presence and in the absence of EGF. We hypothesize that in unstimulated T24 cells Q9H3S7 does not interact with P12931, while it binds to Q05397. Following stimulation with EGF, Q9H3S7 is tyrosine-phosphorylated and releases Q05397 which will ultimately contribute to the turn-over of focal adhesion and, therefore, to cell motility.   \n",

However, the molecular basis for resistance to obesity has been unclear. Here we show that P18031 regulates leptin signaling. In transfection studies, P18031 dephosphorylates the leptin receptor-associated kinase, O60674. P18031 is expressed in hypothalamic regions harboring leptin-responsive neurons. Compared to wild-type littermates, P18031(-/-) mice have decreased leptin/body fat ratios, leptin hypersensitivity, and enhanced leptin-induced hypothalamic P40763 tyrosyl phosphorylation. Gold thioglucose treatment, which ablates leptin-responsive hypothalamic neurons, partially overcomes resistance to obesity in P18031(-/-) mice. Our data indicate that P18031 regulates leptin signaling in vivo, likely by targeting O60674. P18031 may be a novel target to treat leptin resistance in obesity.   \n",

However, the direct targets of P31749 in this pathway are not known. Here we show that P31749-mediated NF-B activation is mediated at least in part through direct phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Q9BXL7, which we previously demonstrated could interact with P31749 in a TCR ligation-dependent manner. The putative P31749 phosphorylation sites in Q9BXL7 are distinct from known PKC consensus sites. Mutation of S551, S637 and S645 in Q9BXL7 to non-phosphorylatable residues decreased phosphorylation of GST-Q9BXL7-linker construct by P31749 in vitro. In addition, Q9BXL7 S637A/S645A mutants were significantly impaired in their ability to restore TCR-mediated NF-B activation and P60568 expression in Q9BXL7-deficient T cells. Thus, our data reveal Q9BXL7 as a novel target for P31749 phosphorylation and suggest that P31749-mediated phosphorylation of Q9BXL7 is an additional regulatory mechanism tuning the NF-B response downstream of antigen receptor and co-stimulatory signaling.   \n",
       "14  The dual-specificity MAPK phosphatase P28562/P28562/P28562 is an inducible nuclear protein controlled by Q8TCB0/42 MAPK (5595;5594) in a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit kinase activity. Here, we report on the molecular basis for a novel positive feedback mechanism to sustain ERK activation by triggering P28562 proteolysis. Active P28482 docking to the DEF motif (FXFP, residues 339-342) of N-terminally truncated P28562 in vitro initiated phosphorylation at the Ser(296)/Ser(323) domain, which was not affected by substituting Ala for Ser at Ser(359)/Ser(364). The DEF and Ser(296)/Ser(323) sites were essential for ubiquitin-mediated P28562 proteolysis stimulated by Q02750-ERK signaling in H293 cells, whereas the N-terminal domain and Ser(359)/Ser(364) sites were dispensable. ERK activation by serum increased the endogenous level of ubiquitinated phospho-Ser(296) P28562 and the degradation of P28562. Intriguingly, active ERK-promoted phospho-Ser(296) P28562 bound to P21583(Q13309) ubiquitin ligase in vivo and in vitro. Forced expression of Q13309 enhanced P28562 polyubiquitination and proteolysis upon ERK activation, whereas depletion of endogenous Q13309 suppressed such events. The kinetics of ERK signaling stimulated by serum correlated with the endogenous P28562 degradation rate in a Q13309-dependent manner. Thus, P28562 proteolysis can be achieved via ERK and P21583(Q13309) cooperation, thereby sustaining ERK activation.   \n",
